376345,5.0,"1,113",True,"10 18, 2005",AILCWT1IIP7ZT,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Charles Chen,"As a software developer, I am literally attached to my keyboard.  On a typical day, I'll spend anywhere between 5-8 hours typing, so it's of critical importance that the keyboard I use is comfortable.  As most programmers and typists can attest, the Microsoft Ergo series of keyboards is the best keyboard for prolonged use.

Having used the Ergo keyboards in some form or another for the past 4 years (most recently, the Wireless Elite set), I must say that this keyboard is a step above.

To begin with, the construction is very solid.  There is far less flex in the plastic and the keyboard as a whole compared to my Wireless Elite.  The wrist pad is made of a nicely textured faux leather material with a tiny bit of padding.  It feels rather durable (not to mention comfortable).  It's a good addition as one of my main gripes with the MS ergo keyboards was that it was hard to fit one of those gel wrist rests around the curved base of the keyboard.

Compared to previous MS keyboards that I've owned, the keys on this keyboard are very well damped in terms of the sound the produce.  It's very muted, even with my hard strokes.  One thing that will take some adjusting to is the increased curvature (along two different planes) between where your pinky and index fingers rest (A,F and J,;).  Whereas the older keyboards have a relatively flat incline, this keyboard has a slight curve (concave).  In addition, there is also a very subtle curve across the keyboard as well (a horizontal curvature), which seems a more natural fit for the shape of hands.  Also of note is the fact that some of the keys have changed shape.  Whereas previously, MS had kept the striking surface consistent across the different keys (even at the edge), this keyboard has several keys along the ridge that have different striking surfaces.

Interestingly, this keyboard also features the return of the front riser (available on the older versions of the MS ergo keyboards).  Actually, in recent months, I've been doing exactly this, but with my own ad hoc methods :) This is a much better solution.  The riser is easily removable for those that prefer the standard configurations.

Note that this keyboard is *USB only*, which means that it may be incompatible with some older motherboards.  Not a problem for me as I'm using it with a newer laptop.  The keyboard does come with software for the programmable keys and extra functions, but it's plug and play right out of the box with WinXP.

I also appreciate the new forward and back buttons for use with web browsing (work with no drivers).  The zoom slider in the middle of the keyboard, however, seems inapproriately used.  It would have been much more useful as a scroll slider instead.

Sizewise, it takes up slightly more surface space than my wireless elite, but is much, much thinner.

My only complaints are that the space key is a little bit stiff out of the box (maybe it'll loosen up a bit after usage), the distance from Ctrl to the number keys seems to have increased a bit (on the scale of millimeters, this is important for those of us hitting Ctrl+F5 quite often ;-), the Delete key is now the same size as the other keys in the cluster (which some people may prefer, but I need to adjust to due to the extra large delete key on the Wireless Elite set), the Enter key is slightly smaller (by 3-5mm), and the key response is not as ""soft"" as say the ones I recently sampled on the MS bluetooth keyboard, but still very comfortable.

Overall, a very high quality keyboard.  If you can wait, there is sure to be a wireless version coming soon.  But anyone that spends a significant amount of type working with computers will be able to appreciate the new layout after 1-2 days of adjustment to the new curvature.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this keyboard to my fellow programmers :)

UPDATE: In the past few days, I've had an inquiry into whether I'm still satisfied with the keyboard.  The answer is a big, bold *YES*.  As I was telling a colleague, this keyboard simply rocks.  I can type hours on end without pain.  My ""seat of the pants"" impression is that I also type _faster_ with this keyboard.  As I pointed out above, I think that most people will have to go through a period of adjustment to really feel comfortable and fall  in love with this keyboard, even if you're coming from a previous Microsoft Ergo series keyboard.",Best Overall Keyboard to Date,1129593600,
376346,5.0,16,True,"10 12, 2005",A300T403J8526F,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},T. Becker,"I've had a Natural Keyboard Pro for years, and now use it at work.  I was looking for a new home keyboard to replace the one from the MS Wireless Optical Desktop Comfort Edition (which is also a fine keyboard - if you're not a gamer; see the reviews for details).  While I liked the comfort curve keyboard, it wasn't a true ergonomic, and it gave me problems in gaming.  So when I saw that MS had redone the Natural Keyboard Pro, I jumped on it.  The reverse slope feels different at first but it isn't difficult to get used to at all.  The attachment does come off if you don't like it though.  The keyboard feels very well put together, typical of MS periphrials in my experience.

I noticed that one user had complained about the software.  If you've used Intellitype before, don't expect anything new in version 5.3, which ships with this keyboard.  As far as I can tell, the only thing added was support for the new keyboards.  I have no major faults with it, although I've never owned a Logitech keyboard so I'm unable to compare it with their software.

The only downsides to this keyboard are that the keys, despite having good feel and feedback are pretty quiet; it's not a clicky keyboard.  Also, with the reverse slope attachment on, it's a very high keyboard, something to keep in mind if you use a keyboard drawer or tray.  My tray will not quite slide under the desk anymore with this keyboard on it.  Still, these are minor faults with an otherwise excellent product.",Best keyboard I've used,1129075200,
376347,4.0,11,True,"10 5, 2005",AFPGV3IQ9K691,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},GDC,"As with most Microsoft products, great hardware, poor software, but oh well.

Now I'm using this thing right now, and I never noticed the spacebar thing, but it's true, if you don't press the spacebar correctly and press it on the upper area, it's hard to press down. I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.

The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.

The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.

Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.

This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.

This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.

Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.

That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.

The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.

The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.

This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.

In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.

I've spent hundreds of dollars on other keyboards (fully-detachable, mechanical, etc.), but this one, at only $35, easily beats them all.  The feel of the keyboard is truly natural.

Some things that I would have liked to have seen:
*additional 6 key on the right
* additional B key on the right
*no number pad
*programmable keys

Additionally, the space bar makes an incredible amount of noise.  It's like 10 times the loudness of the other keys.  The shortcuts don't work for me (I primarily use a Mac), and they don't really look all that helpful anyway (using the dedicated undo button on the top row of the keyboard vs. just using the ctrl/cmd + z motion).

I didn't think i needed anything more ergonomic until my wrists started hurting and my posture started to 'collapse'. Nothing major, I haven't seen a physical therapist or anything, but I figured I needed to make a change. I remember one of my friends has gone through quite a few of these keyboards so I figured why not. I also didn't want to spend a lot.

So here I am typing on it right now after a week of getting used to it. I have to say that i generally find the key action to be a bit muddy. I have a mechanical keyboard and I also type on a lenovo laptop, so these feel mushy by comparison. They work fine though, and the sound is not as clicky, which I appreciate since I think I could do with less audio stimulation at work.

I have it connected to a KVM so I switche between a mac and pc which works fine for my needs. The volume control buttons work on both mac and windows which was a pleasant surprise.

My favorite feature is actually the palm rest. My hands sit pretty naturally there and i can type without feeling fatigued or any of the stress I had grown accustomed to  on my regular keyboards. I know my chair and desk aren't the best, but those things are not as easy to acquire as this keyboard. Because of the shape of the keyboard I can sit up straighter, longer.

<b>Show Stopper - Bad Spacebar</b>
This was basically an ""emergency"" purchase from Best Buy.  It was all they had in stock.  The demo unit I tested had a sticky spacebar.  Or so I thought.  I assumed it was due to it being a demo unit.  Sadly, my unboxed unit behaves the same.  This is common for poor quality keyboards, but the spacebar does not register well on the ends.  The closer to the center you press it the better off you are.  This is not okay for me, especially on an ergonomic keyboard. It's possible it will ""wear in"" but in my experience that isn't the case.

Other Thoughts:
Overall the layout is very good and comfort seems acceptable in my limited use.  I probably won't ever use any of the media buttons or the weird slider in the middle (zoom, I think?).  It's possible the ""Business Model"" here may not have the spacebar problem, but I wouldn't count on it.

It have noticed that my wrists don't have the same ""tension"" in them using this keyboard and an ergo mouse.

I really only use the ""feature buttons"" at the top for volume control. The calculator button is sort of handy. Not exactly sure what the point of the zoom lever in the middle is supposed to be for, zooming in on web pages? images? videos? I don't use it. Or the ""Favorites"" button either. There are Back & Forward buttons just below the space bar as well, which are only handy in very rare situations when you need to step back and forth through your browser tabs history for some reason. There are 5 ""quick access"" buttons that you can program to do different things, apparently. Don't really use them either. Nor do I use any of the F-Lock functions for writing emails from.... (probably) Outlook? I'm a fan of the right hand number pad though.

The feet on the bottom top side prop up the keyboard slightly. I used to flip them up and down sometimes for a few days at a time just to get a slightly different ""mixture"" of wrist strain. I had something kind of heavy fall onto the keyboard in the center and it snapped off both feet, but the keyboard is still chuggin' away at full functionality, so its rather ""tough"" as long as you don't spill anything into the cracks between keys.

I killed one of these keyboards a few years ago with about 1/3 cup of water spilled into the F1 through F5 keys and I lost the ""4"" / ""$"" key, which is NOT awesome for someone who codes. The labels were started to wear off of the keys though, so it wasn't a short life. I usually keep 2 at a time and leave the ""nicer"" of the 2 at the office so my desk looks a little more presentable. My ""warrior board"" at home has all the battle scars. The vinyl covering and the bottom of the keyboard that covers the ""palm rest"" area can start to peel and crack sometimes if you REALLY go hard for awhile. Just pick off the big chunks so it doesn't stick to you. The exposed Styrofoam-like underneath of the pad is still just as ""soft"" and actually looks better than having half peeled and cracked vinyl. Or leave it peeling. It adds some character. Like you know what you are doing or something.

You will need to flip it over and slap out the crumbs, dust, hair and other crud that gets into the crevices every now and then. Sometimes I like to save it up and wait until I get a chance to gross out the ladies with it by doing it front of them.

I've heard the wireless version of this keyboard blows through batteries pretty quickly. What the heck do you need an ergonomic keyboard to be wireless for exactly?... I suggest sticking with the USB ""wired"" version if you want a keyboard that wears its scars like accomplishments, yo. Like gangsters' teardrops or whatever.

I don't really count how many keystrokes I use on each keyboard, but this is the ONLY keyboard that has lasted so long the labels on the keys are almost totally gone on 5 of the keys and its still functioning good as new, aside from a few laptop keyboards, maybe. I do occasionally wipe the keys down gently with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol when the PC is powered down. Because = germs and whatnot. Tap out the crud BEFORE you wipe it down and don't let so much of the alcohol drop between the keys that it won't dry within seconds though.

The best part about the keyboard is the design ergonomic and it is a pretty freaking durable keyboard as long as it NEVER gets wet IN the keys.

1) Comfortable for hands and wrists.  No more pain from typing.
2) wired design is practical, no need for batteries
3) some useful shortcut buttons, such as volume control (plus mute), and calculator

Cons:
1) Very LOUD spacebar.  I actually appreciate the sound of a nice clicky keyboard, but this spacebar makes a big old THUNK ever time you hit it, way louder than the other keys.  Loud enough to wake up my husband sleeping in the same room.

2) Within a short time, the white key markings started to wear off, to the point where I eventually had to buy replacement stickers.  (These stickers then also started to come off, leaving gummy residue behind...)

3) The deal breaker: Eventual sudden death of the keyboard when several keys stopped responding.  I have had 2 of these keyboards (for work and home), and both had this same problem within a couple months of each other.  For both, the top row of numbers were affected, as well as some other randomly located letters and number pad keys.

Bottom line: I would have expected a brand name keyboard at this price to have a decent longevity, but there is clearly a design flaw here, and I will not purchase again.

I initially had trouble with the space bar requiring too much force, but I adjusted to that within a few days. My main complaint about this keyboard is that there is no information about the ""f-lock"" key. I had never heard of such a thing, and I use my function keys (particularly Shift + F3 to change case) a lot. I could not figure out why my function keys weren't working. I am a medical writer, so I spend a lot of time on my computer, and I tend to be fairly technically savvy about such things. Neither I nor my editor could figure it out. When I finally figured it out (with help from yet another person), we realized the f-lock key was the issue and located it and toggled it back on. I then needed to reset the functionality for the Shift + F3 key because in the process of trying to reset it earlier, I had erased its function. It was a big pain and took way more of my time than it should have. I guess some people need an f-lock key? It seems like overkill to me, and it caused me quite a bit of frustration.

I've owned both the consumer and ""Pro"" (OEM) versions. I love this layout, and it's a must have if you live by virtue of your keystrokes. So why the lower score?  The front (pedestal or ""fence"" as I use it) would not firmly snap into the leftmost slot and had a sloppy fit overall. The keyboard seemed to be a bit stiffer and require a deeper stroke but that may be due to it's newness. The action was smooth, Keys not quite as ""clicky"" as the 2014 model.  I use the :""fence to center the keyboard in my lap so no matter how I shift my seating around my fingers are always on  home keys. The pedestal fence issue cost this keyboard two stars, I ordered this model hoping for the brown boxed bulk OEM ""professional"" model. Dell and other distribution channels seem to be out of stock on the OEM bulk model.  I received a blue box similar to the red retail boxes with the latest KU-0462 which has the same large centered key cap labels as consumer model. The business model I'm used to has smaller offset letters in upper left of keys that last longer. A slightly longer cable, and is supposed to be more spill resistant and robust. In the past the business model also had real arrows on the cursor keys and the keyboard bezel had labels such as ""Favorites"" ""Forward"" , ""Back"" etc. The large centered key cap lettering cost this keyboard another star because it won't last long. I contacted the seller regarding my concerns and was issued a lightning fast refund. Seller gets five stars for communication and service.
 I'm somewhat concerned that perhaps MS is only making one 4000 model now.  There's no hope in trying to find a map to models and versions of this keyboard, it's undergone major revisions over the years and despite these improvements all models are 1048  ""V 1.""  All previous models have a design flaw in the internal shielded cable routing.  The shielded cable is bent at a sharp 180 to an S before passing through the grommet at the rear of the keyboard, causing a good deal of stressing to the shielding braid which will break and conductors will fail if the cable flexes often. If you use the keyboard in your lap (best ergonomic position) as I do the cable will fail every couple of years or so if preventative measures aren't taken to reduce flexing at the external grommet interface using something like sugru -a great tip from my friend Cindy. For a desktop user the cable shouldn't fail as quickly.  Also noted on the keyboard I received the label on back no longer says designed in Redmond, WA. Rather mentions an operation in Ireland instead. The label was solid black background and there was no holographic Microsoft security sticker that I could impress my cat with.

If you use this keyboard many hours a day, use the front pedestal to stabilize the KB in your lap for home finger placement and your wrist pain will be a thing of the past.  I work on a couch now and mouse on the cushion next to me. My wrists are never bent, elbows/shoulders never stressed.

EDIT: For those having this issue, it's probably the below, and here's how I fixed it:
Remove top of keyboard (requires popping off the space bar from above because there are screws under it that need to be removed (all of them). There is one snap-off part near the 'End' key.
The clear plastic sheeting with the electrode lines (don't know what to call them) that sit under all the keys, these sheets are 2 layers. It's when the top layer touches the bottom layer that the keystroke is executed. You'll notice a small circular cut-out (I think) on the bottom sheet, that puts a tiny space between the 2 layers. It's when this space is taken up by a button push that the keystroke is executed.

If you lift up the clear plastic from the space bar button, you'll notice a kind of plastic grid that the sheeting sits on for the space bar. If you look at this plastic grid, in the center is a little circular part that extends above the grid slightly. This little circular part is directly below the very center of the space bar button and is where the 2 clear plastic sheets with the electrodes sit during a space bar press. This circular part is pushing the bottom sheet up so that there is less space between the sheets than any other key. I took a small razor knife and made that center circular part of the grid flush with the other parts. This was the fix. Be careful not to carve that piece down below flush.

I wish there was a wrist rest that you could buy that would match the shape of this one, that would be even better, I'd buy it, as I sometimes, need more support.

Like other reviewers have noted, you have to hit it right in the middle, hard, to get it to register. This will create problems for your thumb joint. It also means that if you are a touch typist, you will inadvertently create a lot of typos where the space is missing, that you will have to go back to correct with the mouse. This is even worse, at least in my case, because my biggest problems are from using the mouse too much. Do you remember in the movie The Jerk where Steve Martin invents a little handle on people's glasses to prevent them from sliding down their nose, makes a million dollars, then loses a million dollars because people sue him because they all go cross-eyed? Yep, it's kind of like that.

I'm updating my review and changing it from three stars to one, and here's why.

Update: The only downside of this keyboard is the spacebar. It's really loud! I googled solutions and this appears to be a typical problem.

It did admirably, but after a year or so, my wrists were starting to hurt IN SPITE OF the ergonomics helping.  This one is better rated.  So far, it has helped, but it took at least a week of use just for my hands to BEGIN to get used to the differences.  I'd do a pro/con list, but I'm not sure there are any ""cons"" as compared to ""issues to expect"" if you buy this keyboard.

1.  Expect a steep learning curve to get used to the layout.  The ""bend"" in this keyboard is significant, and it will take time for your fingers to get used to hitting the right keys on a consistent basis.  Give it one or two weeks of regular use before deciding if you like it or not.  You can't know in a couple of days if it's helping you because you do need to re-learn your hand placement and fingering to some degree.

2.  There is a physical break in the left and right hand keys.  This ""no man's land"" means you need to unlearn using the wrong hand for the wrong keys because you will either miskey or just hit nothing when you go to use your right hand to it the G key (or a similar situation).  Likewise, some of the keys have an odd shape that takes getting used to.  I had considerable issue getting used to hitting V and B correctly.  Again, this is all about relearning how to keyboard properly.  My best tip is to avoid looking at the keyboard while typing.  For me, looking at the keyboard made it harder compared to just backspacing and repeating until I got it right.  Passwords are about the only thing where I still watch what keys I strike.

3.  This keyboard is wider and ""taller"" than most.  If you use a keyboard tray, clearing it might pose and issue (see next point below).  You will likely have less room for your mouse as well, but I found it something I could live with.

4.  The keyboard has three (maybe four) resting positions.  There's a removable front skirt that elevates the front.  There are the standard rear folding supports to elevate the rear.  So, that's resting flat (none), rear elevated, front elevated, and both elevated.  Lying flat, the keyboard works fine with my keyboard tray.  Set the way I find it's most comfortable for me, I can only push the tray in halfway before the keyboard hits the desk.  This isn't a deal breaker for me, so I'll live with it.  You keyboard tray may need to allow at least 3 inches of vertical clearance to not have an issue with this keyboard.

I was divided on four or five stars, but since I need this more extreme curve to deal with wrist pain, it's not the product's fault, so I won't hold the awkwardness of it against the designers.  It does what it's designed to do for a good reason.

Microsoft may not be behind this, but it's impossible to get beyond ranks of defensive operators to speak with anyone related to its design and manufacture - always a great fault of MS.

It would have deserve 5 stars if labels wouldn't wear off in less then a year.

So there are a few issues with it:

1) the labels start wear off in about 6-8 month

2) they F keys are labeled for MS Office in mind, for example F5 key is labeled as ""Open"" and F9 as ""Send"", the actual F1-F12 labels are located on the vertical side toward person, which makes it hard to see in not very well lit environment, like with light from the monitor is not enough to see the labels.

3) F-Lock key is in bad position, easy mistake it for F12 key. It should have been totally separate like media buttons.

4) CTRL keys have a ""star"" (asteric) on it - what is it for? Is there a fine print somewhere for these buttons? Weird.

5) LED indicators don't have labels...instead they have icons that also printed on keys themselves. For example Caps Lock is marked as ""A"" in a square box and Num Lock as ""1"" in a square box. Who came up with this nonsense???
Also, LED indicators are in weird location compare to majority other keyboards, it would be perfect if they were integrated into the keys (Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, Num Lock, F Lock)

The pad is comfortable on my hand and after more than a year, it hasn't started to peel or anything from the oils of my hand.
Keys have held up well and the shortcuts on top are mildly helpful (I'm not big on the shortcuts except volume and calculator - but there are assignable buttons for those who want to customize).
I will say that the keyboard is not the quietest and I do find the space bar to have a little more resistance than I was first used to - I only noticed it because I edit videos and use the space bar to play/pause many, many times in an edit.  I've gotten used to it, but if I had known before, I might have picked a different keyboard with less resistance and sound in the space bar (when you let go the space bar, there is a bit of a thunk that is distinctive from the other keys - not too bad, but in those little OCD moments...it's a little annoying).

My previous keyboard was a Logitech Wave ergonomic one, and this one is similar, but has a bit more of a gap/divide/space between the left and right-hand keys, and the curves in the keyboard are a little more extreme - so that'll take a little getting used to.

The only two 'special' keys I really used on my Logitech keyboard were the calculator button and the 'sleep' button - I was really disappointed that this Microsoft keyboard didn't have a sleep button. I was able to program the top/left button to put my computer to sleep, but it took a bit of work. First, I had to go to the microsoft website and look up this keyboard, and download the ""Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center"" software. Then I brought up the software, clicked the key on the virtual keyboard I wanted to program, and put in the following code to run when I press that button ""rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0"". But 'hibernate' mode is turned on in Win10 by default, so that command makes my computer hibernate instead of sleep (and I have to use the power button to wake it, and it takes way longer than waking out of sleep). So I had to run a command prompt window in administrator mode, and run ""powercfg.exe /hibernate off"". Now I've got a sleep button, that makes my computer sleep, just like my Logitech keyboard did.

Hmm ... as I'm typing this review, I notice that the spacebar is making a rattle/click noise every time I do a space. That's gonna get pretty annoying :\",Not quite as great as I'd hoped...,1477440000,

I was sold on the idea by a Best Buy employee (back when they really knew their stuff) after he explained that a keyboard should be arranged in the natural fall of the hand. Not only does this keyboard offer the adjusted direction of the keys but also the raised front, something that most keyboards miss but avoids the depressed wrist that often contributes to tendonitis. This model has always worked immediately after plugging in with various computers over the years. The padding for the pads of your hands is comfortable, even after many hours. You can keep your hands above the pad (which is probably a more proper technique), even when the keyboard is raised if your desk and seat are properly fitted. I will confess that I have gone through several of these keyboards over the years, but every time the malfunctions were due to a stupid person spilling a lot of liquid on the keyboard (that person being me). They have survived small splatters just fine, but no keyboard will survive large amounts of liquid. A destroyed keyboard became a great practice toy for my children, so they are even useful in death. It is not a great keyboard for someone traveling around, as it is pretty large, but it's perfect for a desktop.

I actually had this keyboard in the past and loved it, but one morning keyboard met coffee and that was the end of that.  So I've been typing without it for about 2 years, and I finally decided to go back.

Pros:  the natural hand position does put much less strain on your wrists. I specifically notice it in my pinky finger on my left hand.  I'm able to switch between this keyboard and my laptop keyboard without any problem at all. It doesn't slow me down at all.

Another pro- all of the quick favorite buttons at the top are wonderful. Once set up right you can open your email program (outlook) a web browser, and 5 other programs at the touch of a button. Super convenient, and really easy to set up.

Con- this is about the only one, but the keyboard is rather large. While it fits on my under desk drawer it won't slide under the desk. This isn't too big of a deal, but it could be a problem for some people.","Very comfortable, Easy to adjust to keyboard!",1472774400,

Having thought about this keyboard over the last year and then swapping it out for a standard Dell (non ergonomic) keyboard for the last two weeks has made me realize a few and not so few obvious things:

1) Footprint of ergonomic keyboard on desk is larger than most that I can recall. Not a con but keep that in mind if your computer desk is on the smaller side
2) Build Quality. You buy a top tier (Microsoft, Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc) business OR retail keyboard for a decent price, one EXPECTS minimal issues. There are two issues that have cropped up over the course of the last year: a couple of the tabs holding the snap on palm rest have broken off. The palm rest/riser plastic piece is still firmly attached. My guess is that these plastic clips were put in high stress areas. No loss in functionality. The CAPS LOCK LED light that is in the middle doesn't really work anymore. If I hit the caps lock with my left pinkie finger, the light doesn't come on. If I smash the same caps lock with my thumb or index finger, the light comes on and then goes out. Windows 10 always tells me via the popup message if my caps lock is on. No loss in functionality.
3) Key labels have not worn off. The letters are a bit faded but are still clear. The number row above the keys are virtually pristine (and by extension are used for the comparison of the letter keys).
4) This is a very good ergonomic keyboard. Within a couple of days of the swap, my wrist and left finger were starting to have that familiar hurt.

It was about 90% plug and play on my Linux system. On Windows, there's a special driver to make sure everything works, but no such thing for Linux. Still, almost all the keys worked and it was completely usable. With a few relatively easy configuration changes I was able to get 100% of the keys working as they should. That's very satisfactory. I put maybe 20 minutes into it, compared with the 5 minutes I would have spent installing a driver on Windows. So overall, Microsoft has played fair here and there are no show-stopping incompatibilities, in fact really none at all.

The keyboard has a rich set of functions and features. It takes a little getting used to if you want to get the most out of it, but you can do this ""as you go."" The keyboard is usable as a simple keyboard right from the get-go.

Also on the positive side is that the keyboard is relatively quiet. It's not as quiet as some super-silent keyboards that I've used, but I like the idea that there's just enough audible feedback, which, combined with excellent tactile feedback, leads to more accurate typing.

The keyboard is a little bulky but on the other hand it rests stably on the work surface and doesn't scoot around like some lightweight keyboards.

So, what about the vaunted ergo features?

First, there's a gadget provided that changes the tilt of the keyboard and supposedly provides ergo advantages. I took it off right away; I couldn't get used to the rather extreme tilt downward. Maybe I should have given it a chance but I really hated it. Your mileage may certainly vary.

The wrist rest is comfortable and provides good support. Now, the main feature; the split of the keyboard into two ""sides"" and the angling that goes with it, really takes some accustomization. I mean, really. Even after a couple of months there are some things I find strange and more difficult. I'm a big Emacs user and so the control key comes into play often, and I have caps lock mapped as an extra control key. The ""reaches"" are strange and I've had to alter finger usage to deal with this. But don't give up; after some practice, regular typing is fast and comfortable. The layout of the keys is sensible and generally works pretty well.

The biggest issue, and why I rate this four stars overall, is the spacebar. It takes a lot more force to depress it than it ought to, and it's something you use a lot, so it's a problem. There is a lot online about how to fix the spacebar, but you shouldn't have to.

To be fair, I didn't apply any of the fixes, and with usage, I learned the best way to use the spacebar (pulling my thumb to the side a little). Also, it's loosened up a little with repeated use. But this is a real design flaw.

Do I recommend this keyboard? You can get a Logitech for more money, but I think this keyboard is about right for the price, so I give it a guarded recommendation. You've got to give it time. Don't expect to be a pro with it the first few days. And you've got to learn to work with the spacebar.","Good compatibility, overall good utility",1463788800,

MAC OSX COMPATIBILITY: C-.  The keyboard works fairly well with both my MacBook Pro and my desktop iMac (both currently running El Capitan OSX 10.11.4), but strips them down to basics.

The keyboard gets points for plug and play: you have to ""introduce"" the device to OSX, but it's painless and quick.  Moreover, some special function keys seem to be ready to go out of the box: the volume keys, for instance, work as expected.  ""Play"" calls up your default music app.

But other special function keys aren't recognized: Mail, screen brightness, and the zoom slider don't work.  Some freeware apps can map those for you, but if you're all about right-out-of-the-box, think twice.",Very pleased with the decreased tension in my fingers,1462924800,

What can I say? I like to be thorough - especially for things that you want to last for the long haul.

Let's see, my uses included - school, work, and for a season, some gaming, but nothing too crazy or extensive in that arena (true gamers are more hardcore about it than I am).

My studies and profession include architecture and audio engineering. I have used it with many different programs and general computer use and liked it so much I used it at work and at home. My use has only been on PC with it, so I have no idea about it's use with Apple products. I've used it with Win '98, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7premium in various makes of PC's and even laptops.

I will say the initial use of it (perhaps a week at the time) was slightly odd, however, after that it is very bizarre using a straight rectangular keyboard. The ergonomic feel is great and very natural with my wrists. I am a male, about 5'-9"", weight about 200 lbs (give or take 10 lbs depending on life) with thick hands - strong but with a sensitive touch in case you were wanting to put a physique with the review and see if you are in the same ballpark for reference.

My professions have had me on the computer daily and I can attest to the durability as well as comfort of this keyboard. The key springs are strong but not so much that it feels like your trying to crawl out of a collapsed clay cave.

The shortcuts are good, and I have never ran into any issues with the keyboard not connecting or any misfiring with any of the selected buttons or features. The kickstands initially I did not like, but now I do because of the table placement.

All I can say is that this is by far my favorite keyboard to use on a computer and even spec them for any work computers if I have the chance - and even if I don't, I can bring my trusty one. Mine was purchased in 2006, and is still going strong, I am assuming the current ones are still that well made.

Oh, also, I have used it in an architectural office where we used laptops primarily and docking stations and it worked like a charm.

Get this keyboard, make it through the first week or few of acclimating to it, and then watch your computational life behind this keyboard change. Well, maybe not that much, but you will be comfortable and wonder how you used those rectangular ones for so long once you do enjoy the comfort of this keyboard.",I like to be thorough - especially for things that you ...,1462752000,

Unfortunately, the keyboard occasionally gets locked in a mode where pressing a function key does something other than what you expect. For example, I was just attempting to do a search, so pressed F3.  Nothing found - because F3 has been remapped somehow to be 'Redo' instead of 'Find Next'.  Since this is something that happens only occasionally, it's not something I have memorized how to use, and it took 5 minutes and a google search to figure out how to un-map this and continue my search.

The multimedia keys are fabulous and I have not figured out all of them as of yet which brings to mind that there are NO instructions included other than a basic location designation diagram on the actual outside product box and it's a bit sketchy.

The 10-key portion, I do wish that the NumLock key and the ""="" key would switch places.
Do people switch NumLock On and Off that frequently?
For Excel formulas, yes, you can start a formula with ""+"", but still, they're technically supposed to start off with an ""="" and it would make things much easier, making it quicker...
Or it would have been nice to make the 10-key portion all one clump, making it more reachable and I have decently big hands...
But, I assume they placed that slight distance for sake of uniformity/aesthetics.

Yet, the option of ""="", ""("", "")"" and a backspace right above the 10-key portion is very Excel friendly and appreciated.
I just need to program myself to remember that.

In my experience I cannot use it as I am used to a normal keyboard and do not want to take the time to learn how to use his keyboard (it's split down the middle of the keys with a large lump so that it feels better on the way your hands sit, however it makes typing a totally different experience and you sort of have to ""relearn"" how to type.) but he has had no issues and has been using that type of keyboard for years and years. Of all the ergonomic keyboards out there he likes this one model in particular (and as his break he likes that I order the SAME ONE.) because it has more of a raise in the keyboard than other ones do. He spilled milk on one and shorted some of the keys out and had me order the same exact keyboard, and then the one prior to that just went out after years of use and abuse. (He is an avid gamer, surfs the web, e-mail, social media, everything. Spends a lot of time at the computer.)
So if you're looking for the best ergonomic keyboard you're ever gonna find, this is it. But just realize if you're not used to the split keyboard feature (and it's not physically split I just mean the raised lump) you will have to spend some time getting used to it and re-learning how to type.

2. Open the keyboard settings, then select a button to assign a macro for (e.g. for the Web / Home button)
3. Select the ""Macro"" radio button and click to create a new one, name the new macro ""sleep""
4. Insert the Windows Key via the ""Insert Special Keys"" droplist
5. Double click the Windows key to select it, then right click and choose ""split""
6. Insert an ""X"" between the Windows Keys- this will open the right click start menu
7. Move to the end of the macro, then type arrow keys up, up, right, down, and then press enter- this selects the ""sleep"" menu item
8. See the picture for how things should look in your editor when done
9. Exit the macro editor and test your new sleep key!

Sadly, the 4000 only lasts a few years, at best, and each new one I purchase seems to have lower build quality than the last one. Microsoft (and/or their supplier) seem to be shaving every last penny out of this keyboard. Yeah it looks the same, but lettering wears off the keys quickly, the space bar rattles and has poor response, and the keys have become more noisy and sloppy. The overall feel is far worse than the original 4000.

All the newer ""ergonomic"" keyboards are mostly wireless which has its own disadvantages. Microsoft has also dramatically changed the layout of the delete/home/end/etc. keys on their newer ergo keyboards (like the Sculpt models) and switched to even smaller barely usable function keys. Logitech has the big bloated ugly Wave which is also arguably worse than the 4000. So this keyboard remains the lesser evil among a poor selection of ergo options. I just wish Microsoft would come out with a ""4500"" with the same layout and proper two color injection molded keycaps (instead of cheap silkscreened letters that wear off), higher quality feel, and a better space bar mechanism. I'd gladly pay more for such a keyboard.

A little different approach to keyboard customization that may not be for the ""sunday afternoon"" computer user.  Takes a little understanding of computers and how to interact with them.  Nothing serious, but it's not as easy as some other approaches.  On the flip side, you can get a more complex and potentially useful custom key by building fairly complex key-stroke based macros into the customizable keys.  Very nice.

Keyboard touch and feel are good.  I fuss a little about the raised bar on the F and J home keys.  It is located on the lower edge of the key and I sometimes have to feel for it.  Prefer the raised dot in the center some other boards use but not a deal breaker.  Breakover point is quick, giving a crisp feel, not mushy.

In order to play Fallout 4 for example, I've put poster putty on keys to help find important keys more easily and also keep my fingers from pressing the wrong ones (especially tilde instead of tab, giving me the console instead of opening or closing the Pipboy/menu interface). For general typing, the keys are annoyingly slick and I find myself having to check finger placement because the little F and J marker nobs are easy to miss.

Also, who in their right mind would put a Function Lock key on a keyboard, especially RIGHT by the F12 key? Function keys are essential to a lot of games, and keys becoming suddenly unresponsive is not cool. Microsoft apparently thinks people only use keyboards for email anymore (which is what they've placed as primary labels and uses for the function keys, while the F-number labels get relegated to the side of the key). Bad Microsoft. No cookie for you.

Unfortunately this keyboard seems to be the only real option for the split-key style, so I'm sticking with it even though it sucks. On the plus side, the spacebar isn't giving me as much trouble as I expected, but it is quite noisy and I've probably learned to hit it harder by this point. I think I'll sum up my entire feelings about this keyboard in one word: blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

Original review:

Keep in mind, this is an almost fresh-out-of-the-box review, with about 20 minutes of use. I got the retail version based on reviews saying the spacebar for the business edition is crap, and one review where a person bought both versions and said the retail keyboard's spacebar was better.

So, let's get right to the spacebar itself: it definitely needs a stronger press than the letter keys. The pressing-feel of the letter keys are smooth but the spacebar isn't, and the space has a definite thud/click to it while the letter keys are quiet (not truly silent, but definitely not clicky). Since the space does require a bit of extra push, it'll take some time to see how annoying it is... already not real impressed. Specifically for gaming, with left-hand centered over the WASD keys for movement, the spacebar does becoming notably harder to push properly. New learning of finger-placement to get the thumb further towards the center of the spacebar may do the trick, but that's frustrating because it's muscle-memory for gamers. This wouldn't be an issue if the manufacturer had designed the spacebar properly.

Also, the left-hand resting area with the ergonomic ""pillow"" (which is really just thin soft-ish vinyl-type material over the underlying plastic base) needs to be extended further left. The edge of my hand rests right on the edge, and that's not comfortable and also a little off-putting. The pillow-surface itself feels weirdly slimy due to the texture the manufacturers decided to use, and the keys themselves also feel a little weirdly-slick. This is even more noticeable on the spacebar just based off how much harder you have to push it. The more I use it, the more I get used to it, but it was very noticeable right off the bat... and the keys do have a slight texture to them that seems counter-intuitive to sliding. Coming from an old, very well-worn keyboard with very smooth keys from being so worn, I should not be noticing that the textured keys on a new keyboard feel slippery... but there it is.

Still, this seems like the best keyboard available for the split-key, ergonomic style. I got dragged kicking and screaming into purchasing this because my baby finally died... the trusty old Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite that I've either never replaced or replaced once in the early 2000's (I honestly can't remember). Either way, my baby could no longer be called ""trusty"" due to a years-old short that would often press keys around the scroll-lock button when the keyboard was moved (resulting in random screenshots while playing games on Steam). Sometimes many or all keys would not work until after a thorough, careful cleaning disassembling everything and putting it back together after. The death-knell was when the short would stick one of the shift keys and possibly other function-related keys for an over-long amount of time, resulting in much frustrated key-pressing and faux-all-caps-rage until the thing finally behaved itself again. One cannot play something like an MMO with that kind of performance, and even chatting on instant messenger became obnoxious.

So I have retired my baby and am relegated to this thing. It... works, but it could definitely be done better. If it continues to preform as it does now, I will live with it... if it falls apart quickly, you'll be seeing a very unhappy update to this review. I got the 2-year protection plan just in case, and I'd recommend it since it's less than $3 and may be worth its weight in gold... way more than $3 worth of gold, obviously. Microsoft really needs to bring back the Elite, and all they really need to do is give it a USB plug. The saying is true: they really don't make 'em like they used to... it's all about shoddy everything now, because a well-made product means less future purchases. Sad fact, one the industry does not need to subscribe to but as we've seen over recent years, money beats honor.

It sits a couple inches off of the desk, which helps rest your palms in a more comfortable position for extended periods of typing.

The quick button for a calculator saves you from having to open Start->All Programs->Accessories->Calculator whenever you want to make a quick calculation.  The middle zoom in/out switch is an excellent feature but the best feature in my opinion, and the one I use the most, is the back/forward buttons at the bottom.

Tend to get about 4-5 years out of each one and i am sure they would last ten times as long for most users. I type with my keyboard on my lap and move it around nonstop so i am hard on the cord. That has been the fail point every time but as i said it is very heavy use. By the time the cord starts to cause problems all the letters are long since worn off the keys and its just solid black.

 The shortcut keys on top are useful but the zoom slider is pretty useless. But who needs it anyway. Mute and volume control and calculator shortcut are all handy.

It is still not a perfect keyboard, but despite the funky shape and monster size, it is comfy on the wrists, and if your hands are properly aligned for touch-typing, you can do quite well touch-typing. It is a bit unforgiving if you misalign your hands for touch-typing purposes. The typing angle is pretty good, even though your hands are going a bit downhill.

One pitfall for first time users, the F-Lock button (on the right of the F12) toggles the function keys between their standard functions and different functions assigned by Microsoft. If for example the F3 or F5 are not behaving as expected, just press the F-Lock and all will be well again. I found out the hard way :)

There are many extra buttons, and there is customization and Microsoft software/firmware to install and tweak if you wish. The most unusual placements (but can be handy) are left/right arrows below the space-bar, a zoom button above the space bar, and a dedicated calculator button above Scroll Lock. Of the extra keys, these are the ones I have been using the most .

The space bar is only one key stretching across the entire bottom of the keyboard.  Therefore, when typing, you must either strike it close to the middle of the space bar (which would move my hands away from their most comfortable position) or strike it very hard.  Striking it normally near one of the sides of the space bar does not create enough force over the entire surface of the bar for the entire bar to be depressed.  Additionally, while the letter and number keys are fairly quiet, the space bar is loud and clunky.  If this weren't the most used key on the keyboard it would likely be fine, as its design is fairly comfortable, but a great design can't overcome frustration of struggling to space every two seconds.

It takes a little getting use to while you're becoming familiar with the shape, but once you get used to how it feels and more importantly how it improves productivity, you'll never go back.

If I type on a traditional shaped keyboard for an hour I can feel the stress on my wrists.  This keyboard allows me to work for hours on end without ever feeling any kind of pain or exhaustion in my wrists or hands.

I feel like I'm especially qualified to give a review of this keyboard because I've probably owned a dozen or more.  I buy them 2 or 3 at a time.  Why? If I go on an assignment, I take one with me just in case the client doesn't have one on hand.  I use one on my Laptop.  Heck, I even use one of these on my Apple Mac-Mini.

I spend hours developing.  I can be tough on keyboards.  These hold up well under the strain.

If you're curious or uneasy about the shape, that's understandable.  That said, in my opinion the upside potential is so strong that it's worth a try.

I was a little skeptical that I'd like this as my keyboards in past have all been slim and low keys vs. the taller, squishy keys.  I have to say, though, I'm a believer now in the ergonomic keyboard.

It does take up more desk space than my prior keyboard, but It is SO comfortable to use, that the size becomes a moot point.  The keys are quite and extremely comfortable to press.  I love the elevated and very comfortable wrist rest at the bottom base of the unit.  I do find it much more comfortable to use than my prior keyboards as the position feels very natural for my hands, wrists and arms.

I have not utilized all the functions of the keyboard to speak to those.  The unit feels high quality and not cheap and looks very nice/sharp. I only choose to use wired keyboards only and so was happy to find such a functional keyboard that was also wired, which is harder to find these days as most hardware is made to be wireless.

It did take me a couple of days to get used to the split keyboard as I am a fast typist and found it awkward at first, but now it's extremely easy and second nature to use after a couple of days of use and am back to typing fast again!  The one key I tended to mistype consistently at first was the ""Y"" as the ""7"" key is right above it and the ""7"" key is very big, but that's resolved itself after 2-3 days of use.  I did find my spacebar was noisier to depress than other keys at first but now after 2-3 days of use it has the same, general quiet sound as the other keys.

I switched to these models (the original Natural) when my wrists started to flare up, but before it got to far. Haven't had an issue since and never looked back.

I like to code, so it requires a ton of typing, lately I've noticed stiffness and some pain in my wrists, blatant CTS symptoms, I decided to get a nice ergonomic keyboard to maybe slow down the progress of CTS!
I just want to list a few pros and cons so that you can make your own decision!

PROS
* This keyboard is incredibly comfortable! You can't really tell, but your hands are typing at an angle, your thumbs are higher than your pinkies, so you're pushing inwards to the keyboard, I can type on this thing for hours without feeling stiff or any pain what so ever!

*The keys aren't mushy, they feel like mechanical keys, just with a little bit less resistance. It's hard to explain, but typing is satisfying, it doesn't require as much push as a mechanical keyboard, but it's not the hyper-sensitive Chiclets keys on a standard laptop keyboard, it's just responsive enough to where mis-presses are a thing of the past.

*It also comes with an attachment, it's a ""Raiser"" bar that sits underneath the palm wrest, it raises the keyboard quite a few inches off of your desk, this essentially forces you to be in an ergonomic pose, otherwise it's difficult to use, it really does help with all around comfort and I'm never taking it off! Although, if you don't like it, it's optional!

*It also has a ton of customizable buttons near the top! In the middle is a scroll wheel sort of deal, It's really convenient to have when I'm just browsing the internet, I can use one hand to browse long webpages. I re-bind it for certain games for a convenient melee switch!

CONS

*Nothing is perfect, the learning curve can be sort of tough, I've been typing my whole life, so it only takes me a few hours to get up to pace, but for some people, the learning curve can last a few days. I recommend you use this with your work or home computer whenever accuracy and speed aren't really an issue, and bust out your old keyboard or another replacement if you really need to type fast. If you can touch type, it'll only take a few hours to get used to it!

*It's also has a large footprint, I use a large desk so it's not a problem, but for those of you who may have a space premium, consider something smaller or be prepared to move some stuff around.

CONCLUSION

All in all, I really love this keyboard, it relived the pain in my wrists and arms and has a ton of convenient features, Microsoft has been making these things for years, and there's a reason why, they work and people love them!

The padding at the bottom is not really padding so much as a leathery material over plastic, which I didn't actually mind but was just surprised by. The space bar is also too stiff for my liking, especially for the gaming that I use this for. It does not come with any sort of manual so figuring out how to set the special function keys was a bit confusing and took a bit of Google searching to figure out. I learned that you have to download device specific software to assign the keys, which can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000 . But in regards to typing, personally I had not used a keyboard anything like this before. I had always used laptop keyboards and those iMac bluetooth keyboards. So I'm not really a connoisseur per-say of this kind of keyboard, but to me it was a welcome change and I thoroughly enjoyed using it. I still maintained my 70WPM typing speed, and even was a little faster than usual (granted after I got used to the keyboard about a day later). So all in all great keyboard, except for the lack of manual or instructions of any kind whatsoever.

My husband has very broad shoulders and this keyboard lets him spend hours a day on his computer without giving him wrist pain. The bottom portion of the keyboard is a soft padded material which is very comfortable. This is also a very durable keyboard even with our twin toddlers occasionally banging on it!

Recently,  I spilled some coffee on my keyboard and had to use one of those little chicklett keyboards that comes free with a computer/laptop keyboard... we have it around to use as a backup in these cases. I waited a good week to let my keyboard dry out and I never had such a bad time trying to type on that little keyboard.

I thought I needed to have that and I would still like to own one of those keyboards in the future, but the price and functionality combination in this keyboard is tough to match.

That just takes some getting used to.

I am a nerd and really like the dedicated calculator key. The volume controls are a must have for me on any keyboard. The rest of the dedicated hard keys and shortcuts really mean nothing to me. I thought right away that they would be handy, but I find myself never using them. The software allows you to remap these to just about anything.

I normally rate this keyboard 5 stars but the particular model I got sucks, the one I got is the cheaper model.
Pros;
This keyboard has the Ergo 4000 standard layout and spacing.
In my experience the keyboards last for many years.

Cons:
With this particular model, the keys have a satin finish, small ugly letters and the touch stiff but feels mushy,. Not crisp as I'm used to.

---
It is my understanding there are at least two models of this keyboard, This is the is model I didn't want.
Fixing the cords is easy I just didn't have time.
For cable strain relief I loop the cord and duck tap it to the bottom of the kb to eliminate flexing at the keyboard edge which is where the wires eventually break.

Other thoughts.
I work in the dark a lot. Wish MS would listen to the demands by long time Ergo 4000 users to bring back the Ivory color.

The split in the middle enables me to hold my hands at their natural angle, rather than having to slightly bend the wrists outwards.

The keys have become softer. I don't remember a ""break-in"" period on my previous 4000, so only thing I can think of is that they've changed the key mechanisms.

It is the first time I have used an ergonomic split keyboard.  I am a medical transcriptionist and type for a living.  At first I found it awkward, I kept reaching too far for some keys, and it seemed that I was always missing the right-sided home row by one key.  Now I find that I'm not thinking about the keyboard at all, which means it is working well for me.  I find the key ""touch"" to be a little on the firm side, which means that I occasionally miss a letter because I didn't push hard enough, but I think over time I will adjust to that, too.  This keyboard does not ""click"" when you type, which means it is generally quiet.  Personally, I prefer the clicking, but for work, I wear a headset and don't hear the keyboard at all, so this is not an issue.  Of course, with the need to press the keys harder, there is more thumping than I think I would normally hear when I type.  As far as the alignment, it seems excellent.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, which is well controlled, but I still have some stiffness and loss of range of motion in my fingers and wrists, and the angles of the keyboard seem to be perfect for me, and I don't feel as much strain as I used to in my wrists after working all day.  There is one thing I wish was included, and that is a lighted keyboard.  I have never had one, but I have worn the letters off the keys of several keyboards, plus it would just be helpful to be able to see the keys more easily for those times when you don't have bright light or so your eyes don't have to adjust to dim lighting after staring at your bright monitor screen for a long period of time.  After less than two weeks, I can already see shiny spots on the space bar and some of the most-used keys, so I know the letters will start wearing off soon.  Not a big deal, but a lighted keyboard would be a really nice feature, perhaps an option that could be offered in the future.  If you are considering this type of keyboard, I think it is worth the minor aggravation of needing some time to get used to it.  My impression is that my hands and wrists will be thankful I made this purchase.  UPDATE JULY 22, 2015:  The keyboard started acting strangely yesterday morning, some keys not working at all, some keys creating the wrong letter or digit, and the period key seemed to be stuck.  I tried to file a claim using the extended warranty, but because it was still under the manufacturer's warranty, they told me to contact Microsoft, and they gave me the wrong phone number for Microsoft.  Microsoft wanted the keyboard to be shipped back to them in California, and they would send a replacement AFTER they received this one.  I use the keyboard for work, and I don't have a week or more to wait for a replacement.  I asked for my money back, which they agreed to do, BUT they then sent me on a wild goose chase trying to make that happen.  It seemed that no one with Microsoft had any idea of how to help me and they didn't seem interested at all in helping me, although one person I spoke to at one of the wrong numbers I was given was very kind and helpful in spite of my anger and frustration (thanks, Sachin!), but he couldn't help me either, and he said I needed to contact Amazon.  This was definitely NOT Amazon's problem, but you know what?  They made it right.  No arguments, no questions, no lengthy explanations, no making me feel like I was trying to take advantage of them.  I asked for their help, and they apologized for the troubles I had experienced and sent a new keyboard.  I have heard people complain about Amazon, but as far as I'm concerned, they are AWESOME.  Microsoft and Square Trade Warranties not so much.  This keyboard should have lasted longer than a few months, and Microsoft's customer service was horrible when I needed help, so when I have to purchase another keyboard, I probably won't buy another Microsoft product.

One thing I don't care for is that Microsoft changed the rightside 'Windows key' to a 'context key'.  I can see where that would benefit some, but I'd prefer to be able to assign the ""win-key' function to the right-side, as I'd use that side w/ the ""Ctrl + Win-key"" shortcut much more than the leftside ""Win-key"".  I may be able to reassign that, as there is some customizable function available, but I haven't really looked into it yet.
[Comments w/ 'advise' always appreciated.;)]
Its been nice to lose the 'sticking keys' problem, but I may have to lower my desk an inch or two, because the riser & my 'adjustment' now have my hands about an inch & a half higher than before.  That seems to be the biggest difference, & one that I'll likely have to compensate for.  As soon as I can get a 'roundtoit'.
It would 'prolly be a good idea for most of us to reassess our personal ergonomic space on a regular basis, but again, I'll need a 'roundtoit'.

However the honeymoon phase was exactly that... and my keyboard soon died, one key at a time.  After a couple of months of use (up to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week).  By the time I couldn't handle it anymore, 13 keys were down for the count: C, I, O, U, Y, Z, the main ENTER key, the  key, /, *, -, Insert, and Delete.  Needless to say, the inability to use these keys made this keyboard useless.

Hoping that there may be a debris under the keys issue - I cleaned it out.  Since I had only had the keyboard a couple months, there was nothing to be cleaned out.  I deleted and re-installed the keyboard and intellitype pro drivers, and it still didn't help.  I tried other USB ports, on my computer and several other computers... still didn't work.

But I hated the fact that the keys between the alpha keyboard and numeric pad were rearranged from the industry standard.  Why do vendors think they should mess with the standard layout?  Does it save them a few cents in manufacturing cost?

It takes some getting used to but once your muscle memory gets re-wired to the slight differences in key size and placement, it's great.  I'm very glad I went with this one instead of their newest one which I was considering.  It is less expensive and I think more practical from a software development perspective.  Two things I wish they had done better though - the enter key is a bit too small and that zooming dealie would be much more useful as a scroll wheel.  As luck would have it, for a project I'm working on it makes a great dedicated zoom tool.  It is useful occasionally for zooming in and out with Firefox but that's all I've really used it for beyond my own custom software.  It came with the incline already installed so I decided to try using it like that although I haven't used it that way in the past.  Trust me leave it on.  Once you get used to it it's more comfortable.  One other note - this keyboard is pretty big.  Probably the biggest I've ever had, but big for a reason.  I have larger sized hands and could see someone with small hands having some issues stretching say from the home position to the control keys.  In the past they've had the cross layout for the cursor keys that I really disliked.  They've corrected that with the more intuitive inverted 'T' layout.  For me - a person with larger hands that develops software - it's the best comfiest keyboard available.

I've never typed on an ergonomic keyboard before. I usually get a typing speed of around 80-90WPM, but my speed fell to about 40 when I first plugged it in. I went to typeracer.com, and slowly built my speed back up. It's just one of those ""You'll have to get used to it"" kind of ordeals. I should mention if you use the numpad during gaming, namely first person shooters, I always set it to 0/ins is sprint, and + is jump. This keyboard seems to have a ghosting issue, meaning if you're holding down sprint, and want to jump, the jump key isn't going to respond, you have to release sprint then QUICKLY press jump. Annoying as hell, but I've had keyboards in the past that did this. I should have expected it honestly. Now, this keyboard does have other keys, as you can see. Home, search, e-mail, favorites, mute, vol down, vol up, play/pause, calculator, back, forward, and zoom. Personally, I disabled the zoom key, I found it annoying. The favorites keys you can assign to open a web page, file, or program, using the Microsoft mouse and keyboard center (if you're connected to the internet, as soon as you plug this keyboard in, it will automatically download that software from Windows Update). The F keys also double as various commands. I personally just keep that turned off, so when I press ALT + F4, it'll close the window instead of opening a new one (F4 on this keyboard is ""new""). F2 and F3 are undo and redo, but you can also use CTRL + Z, and CTRL + Y, respectfully, so I remapped those to previous song/next song :) above the numpad, you also have additional keys, equals, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and less than. Since I use this keyboard for personal use, and not professional use, I haven't touched those keys. It has the usual two prongs near the top to prop it up, but it also comes with a base, to prop it up from the back, instead of just the front. The rubber strips make this keyboard quite comfortable to type on, and with the stand and prongs, it's elevated height make it even better for me. If you want to type comfortably, and have time to adjust and get your speed back up first, then I recommend this.","Looks weird, feels great...wait?",1419120000,

This is a fantastic keyboard. I use this keyboard for about 8 hours a day at work and I thoroughly enjoy it. For any software devs looking at this board: buy it; it is great for software development and I don't know a dev that wouldn't recommend it.

That being said, I was very hesitant of the split design at first, but my wrists were hurting and I was desperate. The transition from regular keyboard to this is somewhat difficult, but after about 2 weeks I found that I could type better on this than a regular keyboard. The front and back can be raised and lowered so you can find the correct position for your wrists (they should not be bent). I used to find myself taking pain relievers after work due to my wrists, but they are no longer an issue thanks to this keyboard. I did not switch desks, chairs, mice, or my posture, so I am fairly confident that some feature of the keyboard is what relieved the pain.

The only issues I have seen is that the keyboard does wear out over time. The letters get worn off and the typing gets very ""clackey"". I was previously using a friends old keyboard (same model), which had lived through 3 years of hard use. The keyboard software is iffy, I could never get the hotkeys to work, but I have seen it working perfectly on other computers. I would probably give this product a 4/5 stars if it weren't the best damn ergonomic keyboard on the market right now, it has no competitors that come close.",Best Ergo-Board as of Late 2014,1418860800,

3 major complaints:
1 - No F keys visible. Doing a lot of web designing using WordPress, the F5 refresh key is used frequently. Of course a programmable board such this has an F-Lock key, but that means engaging the lock before the Function keys can perform normally. Then, they aren't even labeled. It is a case of user-friendly overkill. Instead of F1, F2, etc. we have Help, Undo, Redo, New, Open, and so forth.
2 - This has to have the noisiest space bar I've ever heard. It has a metallic click on both press and release. And the bar, having to stretch wider than normal, tends to tilt unless tapped very near center.
3 - The right Shift Lock is a huge stretch from the normal right hand rest position. The left side is ok but the right side from the ""Y"" to the Shift Lock is uncomfortably far away.

CON: The end where the cable attaches to the keyboard is very flimsy. Many other keyboards have a rubber neck at that point for added support.
CON: I usually keep 2 or 3 spare keyboards because they're very sensitive to liquid. I doubt they're using water-soluble circuit pens to make the circuits, but I've had several stop working. The keyboard covers for them interfere a lot with typing, so I don't use them.
SUMMARY: Being able to type for hours outweighs the inconvenience of having to keep spare keyboards on hand. I type A LOT, so much that after a month or two, the letters are worn off from the usual main keys. That's not a ding in quality, it's happened with every keyboard I've had in the last 15 years.

If you haven't used the split keyboard before, here's the scoop:

If you a touch typist ""by the book"" and use the home keys and the recommended finger for each letter, you will get used to the split very quickly.

If you have your own touch typing system, and you are used to reaching across the center of the keyboard for letters (i.e., using your left hand to type t, r, f, etc., then it may take a while to get used to it, but it's worth it in terms of comfort while typing.","Been using this for 20 years, a must-have for an ergonomic work setup",1417910400,

If I wrote a review right after I got it, I would say it was awkward, keys are a little stiff, and keyboard is large. Now after a few weeks, I say, I like the feel of the keys, stiffer than my old Logitech keyboard, but I get better feedback that I have fully hit the key and I have less accidental partially hit key errors.

Pros: less keyboard typing errors, comfortable hand positioning, good tactile feel to keys, love the middle Zoom button, nice aux key layout, easy volume control buttons at top, nice quality feel to it, not wireless, no batteries to replace.

Cons: took a little while to get used to it, a little larger on my desk, not wireless (also a Pro), no sound indicator when I hit the caps lock (does light a light on front center indicating on/off which is nice), Home & End keys took awhile to get used to - different from previous keyboard... but now not a problem, keys & space bar a little stiff - also a pro - depending on what you like.

I had a Bluetooth Logitech keyboard prior. OK board. Did not like it being Bluetooth. Had to use a USB dongle, on boot up, keyboard was not immediately recognized. I rarely move my keyboard more than a few inches now & then so wireless/Bluetooth is not really needed. The wire is attached to the keyboard (can't be removed) and is about 5' long. Fortunately, my monitor has 2 USB ports - because my computer is behind me and would require about 10' cord (you can always get a USB extension if needed).

I don't find the keys to be noisy. There is a slight click when pushed - which I like. I work at home, alone... so any keyboard noise is irrelevant to me. But even in an office situation, I doubt this keyboard is any louder than most other alternatives.

For the money - got it on sale - this is a great keyboard. Has ""favorite"" keys which I haven't programmed yet, and other features I haven't used... my typos have decreased significantly, and I really like the feel of the keys.

In the area between the two keyboards is a little button that if you push it up it will zoom in on your web page, push it down it will zoom out. I wish it would go to 100% if pushed down... but there is a little box that pops up showing the zoom %. Very handy when viewing small text or videos in websites that won't let you resize.

The Home key is in the middle of the 6 keys top right - to the right of the Insert key. The End key is in middle bottom row just under the Home key. The Page Up and Page Down keys are on far right of the group of 6. Delete is below the Insert key. The Home & End keys are in different location than my Logitech board, at first I thought it awkward, but now find it as a better layout.

The volume up, down, mute buttons are silver and on top row on right end. They are well spaced so mute is easy to find and volume up/down are right next to each other for easy volume control. The video/audio play/pause button is to the right of the sound buttons. I found this button does not always work - depending what you are watching.

The F keys have multi-functions, I rarely, if ever use them for the alternate function - such as Undo, Redo, Close, Send, Spell, Save, etc.... I'm too used to keyboard shortcuts ctrl+c copy, ctrl+v paste, ctrl+z undo, ctrl+s save, ctrl+x cut, etc... no need to move my hand to find the right F key.

Cap Lock - at first I was disappointed that it did not make a beep when selected like my Logitech board which had one tone for on, one for off.... instead the MS board has 4 lights in the silver area center bottom of board. The top like is green when there is power on. The 2nd light lights up when Caps Lock is pushed on and goes off when Caps are off. Actually like it better than the sounds. The sounds were nice to alert you that you accidentally hit the Caps key not the Tabs key... but was harder to remember if Caps were on or off... the light makes that easier.

There is a forward/back arrows on the front center silver area above the lights... could be nice when browsing on the web. I tried them and they work fine... I use a Logitech Revolution wireless mouse that has fwd/back buttons on the side of the mouse. So I don't use the keyboard.

Number Keys are standard... but just above them are 4 keys which if you get used to using could save time:  =  (  )  <

I got a Microsoft Natural Keyboard to try to help the problem. That was 16 years ago, and I still use that keyboard at home today. The handrests, space bar and several frequently used keys are all worn smooth, but it still works as well as the day I got it.

I started having the same issues again, and realized it was my keyboard at work. I bought this keyboard to use at work, and the problems immediately went away. This new keyboard is a vast improvement over my 16-year-old version. The handrests are a soft neoprene type substance. The keys are very easy to work with, and there are a ton of extra buttons that can be assigned to do whatever you want: bring up a calculator, open your email, and so on. There is also a zoom wheel that performs different functions depending on the application you're in.

I adapted to this new layout instantly, people not familiar with using a split keyboard may take a little while longer to get used to it. My only complaint is that the space bar is a bit stiffer than I would like - for the first few days I kept missing spaces because I wasn't hitting it hard enough.

If you're having any kind of carpal tunnel issues due to your keyboarding, you can't go wrong with this keyboard. Highly recommended!","Excellent, high-quality keyboard, instantly resolved my carpal tunnel issues",1417305600,

This has proven to be the most comfortable one so far. I had one of these at my last job and I ended up buying one for my current job and for home.

I recommend buying the business version (this keyboard is also available in the home edition.) While a little more expensive, the business version comes with a small stand that can be removed to make the angle of the keyboard change. The home version does not come with this stand. Because of this, the angle for the home version cannot be changed and you are basically forced to use the keyboard in only two positions in opposite to four as it is the case with the business version.

People who hit the keys very strongly (as if using a typewriter), may find this keyboard not as strong. However, for someone who does hit keys very hard like me (I learned to type on a very old Remington typewriter), I have already put about three of these keyboards to the test and all the keys have survived me.

I would also definitely recommend this keyboard for anybody who is suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome or any other sort of pain around the wrist area. The support for the wrists is pretty large. I had keyboard-used tendonities and first stages of carpal tunnel and that's the reason why I had to switch to natural and ergonomic keyboards long time ago. This keyboard has definitely helped me and I'm no longer in pain when typing. Of course, everybody is different and your results may not be the same as mine.

ok - it was not expensive, but when getting a keyboard to be used 10+ hours pr day, the cost is not the most important - but rather the quality of it.. Is it made by Toys'rUS? It feels like a toy, and act like a toy.

For anyone who looks for a good keyboard, keep looking - This is not what you look for. The keys are ""flappy"", the spacebar wobbely and not sure if it even have a stabilizer. Sometimes the the keyboard sends things on its own, which can be bad when you have carefully selected text/files, and suddenly the selection goes away. Double work, and not very business friendly.

I have been using a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard for many years, which felt like a PRO version compared to this one.

The config software does not allow to configure all keys either, but yes, by manually editing the config files you can control every key,.. that is - until random refreshes the software seems to do, which resets any modifications you might have done and you have to do it all over again.

But, the Ergonomic 4000 is a huge piece of hardware, and perhaps can be used to knock intruders in your home.

Microsoft: WHY did you stop making Quality hardware?  The same goes for the Trackball Explorer, the best trackball there was, then it was discontinued., Hardware is obviously something you don't know how to do, so leave that to the professionals.

This is the best version of the ""natural"" layout and does wonders for my wrists.  Going back to a standard after this and my wrists start to hurt within minutes.  That's how I know the shape isn't just a gimmick.  The soft padded synthetic wrist pad makes me feel like I'm typing on a keyboard made for a rich rapper or something.  The key's are velvetty smooth, it's just a dream to type on.

Why only 4 stars?  for the same reason why I've owned 5 of them.  There's really nothing between the keys and the internal compartments of the keyboard.  something like a soda overflowing or condensation dripping from the outside of your glass might get to the inside.  They keys are detected via two mylar sheets with electronics on them.  They pretty much become useless once something from the outside touches them.  in contrast the cheap version of this keyboard has a tray under the keys that keep almost everything out and separated from the internals.  So I've had 5 of these really nice ones, which I pick up when they go on sale, and my old beater natural keyboard that I use when a drop of water gets inside the 4000 and inevitably breaks it.

Since I spend at least 9-10 hours per day at a keyboard, I quickly decided I wanted to get something that would not contribute to this problem. I'm pretty hard on my wrists between having a desk job, playing drums, and riding my motorcycle, and I want them to last my whole life.

After reviewing options online and talking to a coworker who had the Microsoft 4000, I decided to buy it. I've used it for a few weeks now and want to get a second one for home use. I really love it - so much so that I'm annoyed by using my laptop keyboard when I'm in meetings.

The split design takes very little time to adjust to, and the slope of the keys away from my body feels very natural (you can also remove the riser in the front so the keyboard lays flat). As some other reviewers noted, the space bar does tend to be a bit stiff, but once you get used to the key weight you'll find very little trouble typing what you intended. I love the way the wrist rest feels too!

When I was looking around, my main hesitations were that the keyboard wasn't wireless (I really wanted a Logitech wireless keyboard to pair with the tiny receiver on my Logitech mouse), and I also would have liked to see backlit keys, especially on a wired keyboard. In the end, these would be nice improvements for the next generation of this keyboard, but their lack doesn't bother me enough to offset a star.",Makes quite a difference on my wrists.,1413504000,

For context, I spend most of my time at a keyboard, at work and at home. I type fast, I key too hard, and I spend 4-6 hours a day typing (not sitting at a computeractively typing). My first two MS 4000 keyboards lasted 3-4 years each under that abuse. They were my first ergonomic keyboards and I loved them. The many other reviews on this product do a good job of explaining the pros and cons. This keyboard has worked so well for me that I've replaced it with the same keyboard every time. I buy them at work so I can use them there, too. When I've been responsible for ordering keyboards for others, this is the one I get.

However, starting three or four years ago, I noticed that the keyboards weren't lasting as long. The physical action of the keys was fine, but something would go wrong with the underlying membrane, or the electronics. A key would stop working, or key mappings would get strangely scrambledone keyboard started outputting two letters per key press, but only for half the letters and none of the numbers. This would happen within 12-18 months of purchasing the keyboard.

My last two keyboards have died within 8-12 months.

This is pretty annoying, but for the low price, it's still worth it for me to buy a new one when the old ones die. But if you're here looking for the reliable workhorse keyboard of the past, you may want to look elsewhere.","Used to be perfect, but quality has gone down significantly in the past 3-4 years",1406592000,

The Review pertains specially to using it with a Mac.

After about 3 weeks use, the keys a, s, d, & e no longer show their names;  letter labels have worn off.

No manual came with the keyboard, which requires programming, though you may be able to find how to program it by searching the internet and trying to find a manual on line.  Then you need to download a driver for the keyboard.

In many ways this is a dream keyboard after you get it programmed.  It has about 15 special keys that need programming.  These are a great convenience.  After downloading the driver, you go to the Mac System Preferences.  In the bottom row an icon is now present for this Keyboard.  Having entered that icon, you may program the special keys, most of those keys having a menu of assignable choices. Generally, once you are in the MS Keyboard icon, if you press a programmable key, a menu pops up of alternative assignments from which you choose.

Also, I love having the split, contoured, ergonomic keyboard -- it should discourage carpal tunnel syndrome.

I have my keys assigned for
scroll/jump down,
language change (to Greek or English),
open default browser,
open Word,
eject,
Site 1 = a forum,
Site 2 = hotmail,
Site 3 = another forum
Site 4 = YouTube,
Site 5 = Amazon !
(5 keys are to program 5 favorite websites.)
mute,
volume up,
volume down,
 iTunes next track,
dashboard.

In the center of the main keyboard there is a rocker switch which zooms in & out what you are seeing on many screens, like the internet.

The split keyboard is great for typing in low light for a touch-typist.  Once you get your hands in the right place (easy to do) you can do a lot of typing without light.

Drawbacks for me:

1) letters wear off,

2) not wireless.

3) there are no scroll wheel, trackball, or mouse buttons on the keyboard.

I can scroll down using a programmed key, but not up (actually it is an incremental jump down, requiring about 5 pushes to make a whole screen go down).

BTW, IOGear makes a smaller keyboard that is very convenient keyboard that has mouse buttons, trackball, & scroll all built in & is wireless -- but my hands get lost on the keyboard in the dark, its keys are closer than I want, and the built-in trackball & scroll function quit working soon.  I have owned something like10 of the IOGear keyboards, and all have gone bad in about 3 months.

3) Some genius years ago decided to put the number 6 on the left side, where it does not belong for touch-typists. The number 6 is supposed to be operated by the right index finger in touch-typing.  But it is now divided off to the left.

4) It is too wide for my use.  I like to type in my lap sitting back from a very large monitor screen. This keyboard is so wide that it does not fit between the arms of my easy chair, and if I center the keyboard for typing, it then sticks out way to the right.  I don't need the keypad on the right.  It makes the keyboard too wide for me.  I intend to try surgery; cutting off the right side number pad.

Thus for my use Microsoft should produce this keyboard with
no number pad, thus not so wide,
key letters that don't wear off,
wireless,
built in mouse keys,
built in trackball,
built in scroll wheel,
number 6 on the right side

BTW Microsoft did have a wireless version of this; but apparently it is now off market/ unavailable largely -- I have not checked Ebay.  I did find a wireless one for sale somewhere at an astronomical price.",Almost Good; Letters Wear Off Keys Quick,1405814400,

One start is a really low rating but that is because the space key is horrible, and seeing as that is possibly the most used key, it is a serious problem.

I've NEVER had a keyboard spacebar have the problems this one has, and after I started to google it, saw literally years worth of complaints on the exact model - and there is zero excuse for not having had this problem fixed years ago.

The keys need to have what I call ""snapback"", meaning the action is crisp, with an elasticity which means the keys aren't mushy and they jump back with a ""snap"" after being depressed.  The ergonomic aspect of this keyboard is beautiful.  I can't properly use a regular keyboard - it hurts my wrists and causes me to create more typos.  On average, an ergonomic keyboard helps me create about 25% less typos (I type very fast).

The hot-button keys are still archaic, but elegant if you go for those things.  The ""Zoom"" button in the middle of the board can be extremely useful.  The hand-rest is one of the best ones out there for any keyboard.  The board itself is perfectly balanced and tilted.  The legs that you extend out of the bottom are pretty worthless so be prepared when they break.

Someday we will see clear keys on keyboards, all of which are programmable.  We will see a scrolling wheel (already has appeared actually) which allows us to combine our F-function keys with our number keys and out hot-button keys all into one row of keys, which have menus we can scroll through.  But for now, we have this old style board, and for the money, the MS 4000 is the best one out there.  The only other keyboard with a feel as good as this is from Logitech, but it is priced too high.

This is the fourth 4000 I've had.  The letters on the keys are already wearing off and I'll go through the same routine I always do: test all the new keyboards, read about all of the others I can't test because CompUSA went out of business, and then go buy another 4000 to replace my old one.","One of the best, and super cheap!",1402099200,

1. Google how to change the zoom slider to a scroll slider (it IS possible and actually pretty easy)-unless you are a graphic designer, you will thank me later.
 2. This will keep your coworkers from throwing you, and the keyboard out the nearest window...
CAREFULLY pry off the space bar, you will find two identical sets of paired posts with holes on each side of the space where the key was, the bottom hole is where the guide pin goes, the top is just for stability of the space bar when you press it down. THIS is the post you need to focus on, grab a very thin piece of rubber (about 1mm thick) and cut a small circle just enough to cover the whole and glue it on top to act as a damper. The space bar is the only key on the board that makes a definite tapping sound when you press it. All the other keys are dampened enough by the membrane underneath. Do this small thing and you will have a very quiet keyboard and happy coworkers. If you don't do this then remember that the keyboard is pretty wide and solid and makes an excellent sound when your coworker picks it up and smacks you across the head with it.

Although the layout is something that not everybody would like, but I do find it actually helping with my touch typing since now I don't have the tendency of hitting the keys with the wrong hand. It has plenty of extra keys that can be used to bind to useful commands including media control (it is really noisy in our office so can't concentrate properly without music).
My biggest problem though (the reason that I subbed 2 stars) is the lack of configuration. The only way to access the extra keys is through the microsoft keyboard and mouse center which is a really limited utility and also the fact that the knob in the middle is set to ""zoom"". From their utility you have only 2 options - ""zoom"" or nothing. (btw ""zoom"" is just ctrl+scroll) And it is impossible to make it scroll (a much more useful function in my opinion) without hacking through the configuration xml files and even after doing so - one of updates just reseted everything so I'm back to ""zoom"" and I can't use a different hotkey manager to control that, since only the microsoft utility can work with these extra keys.

I would think that MS could easily fix this by cutting the space bar in 2, but as it stands sometimes when you hit the very edge of the space bad it doesnt activate the key and put a space into your sentence.

Also, some of the extra buttons are pretty nice and some even work without installing the driver (calculator, back & forward buttons, etc.) if you're really in a hurry for some reason.

I do have a complaint, though:  I'm a heavy emacs user and I have so many key bindings that I even use the windows-key in many of my bindings.  Since there is only one Windows-key, I can't do the two-hand-two-presses-at-the-same-time thing like you can do with two shift keys or two ctrl keys (example: holding down right shift key with right hand and pressing 'w' with left hand to quickly type 'W'), which does slow me down a bit.

However, I can't subtract stars for that because I imagine the vast majority of users don't even use the windows key at all.

It's nice
It's comfortable
I prefer the split keyboard

Cons
It takes up a lot of space. A ridiculous amount.
The keys wear out quickly. I've had mine for 6 months and the A, S, and E keys are all black now.
I use the extra features rarely, if ever. The scroll wheel in the middle seems to work for zooming but not scrolling.
The scroll lock is off by default. No biggie. Except every time you fire up and use Excel you have to turn it on.

I've always used Microsoft keyboards but it's time to switch. They have just gotten of lower quality over the years. And I have to get a new one at least every year.

I've been using the ""Natural Keyboard Elite"" (white, PS/2 connector) at work and home/office for over 10 years. A bottle of Snapple Peach Tea (my favorite) was spilled on my home keyboard recently. Immediate shaking and blotting did not save it and the next day, several of the keys were obviously hard to push and slow to retract (""gummed up"" is the technical term I think). I've ""washed"" keyboards before (by hand and via dishwasher) with mixed results and before I chanced anything with this keyboard, I looked for a new one. Of course Microsoft doesn't make the ""Elite"" anymore and this keyboard (the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"") was the closest I could find, so I ordered it for next day delivery.

I don't consider myself a keyboard snob, but I guess I am, as so much about this keyboard bothers me. I guess I'll start with the positives though.

Pros:
* Split/humped design is good for your hands/wrists and possibly other joints and spine (plus other people will be dissuaded from trying to use your computer)
* Real full-throw keys, not chicklets or membrains (though lower profile than the old ""Elite"" keys)
* Wired (no batteries to replace or radio signals to intercept or jam)
* Soft wrist pad is comfy
* Extra buttons/scroll/zoom/app controls can be convenient
* Full-size pyramid-style dedicated arrow keys (unlike the smaller 'T' layout on the ""Elite"")
* The num pad is perfectly normal except for unnecessary ""rounding"" of the keys
* The additional mathmatical/algebraic keys above the num pad are cool, but (3 of them) require special MSFT software to enable - spreadsheet ""programmers"" probably really like these (=, (, ), and backspace)

Cons:
* Keys are ""mushy"", especially the space bar - this is my biggest gripe with this keyboard
* Space bar has a weird initial resistence to press and after exerting sufifcient force, makes a very audible ""plunk"" sound as the key reaches the floor - this happens with either the left or right thumb/side of the space bar (or dead-center press)
- Every other key is extremeliy quiet, onliy the space bar provides the periodic annoying ""plunk""
* Keys are asymetrical (e.g. the 'N' key is about 3-times wider than the 'M' key, '7' is at least twice as wide as '8' and '6' is smaller than any normal key) - if you're a touch typist, these don't matter so much but the keyboard occasionally feels very strange when I feel the edges of keys that are completely foreign to me
* Function keys are about 2/3 size (similar to the ""Elite"", but rounded) and have that stupid ""[F] Lock"" thing
* USB only (hey, some of us like to use our USB ports for other stuff and that PS/2 port is just going to waste)
* No USB hub functionality (as long as it's going to eat a USB port on my system, give me another port to plug my mouse or other HID into)
* Keyboard is about 4"" deeper than the old ""Elite"" model - this thing's a beast

So I've ""washed"" my Elite and blown it out with an air compressor. Hopefully that'll return it to the previous state and I can stop using this black beast (I do prefer the color though).

If you love this keyboard, more power to you, it's just not for me (or my fingers, or my ears)!

UPDATE: I purchased the Perixx PERIBOARD-512W (I guess I prefer white afterall) from Amazon and immediately (and happily) stopped using the Microsoft 4000.

I found it a bit amusing that it had a warning label on it talking about things like carpal tunnel and other muscular disorders etc. There is a reason this sticker is there, it is because the space bar on this thing is so far beyond bad that if you use this for more than a few hours you will get carpal tunnel. Keep in mind that the space bar is quite possibly the most commonly used key!

If you look around the internet you will see people trying to fix this things space bar. Just do a quick search. If you are the type of person that wants to pry off the space bar on a brand new keyboard by all means go for it, this is the perfect product for you.

When I bought another one almost a year ago, I figured it would last at least as long as the first one (which wasn't nearly long enough in my opinion) - but alas all of the special keys across the top (web/home,search, mail, mute, volume, calculator) have quit working.  I tried uninstalling the keyboard and then downloading and installing updated software from Microsoft thinking maybe that was the issue.  It didn't make an ounce of difference.  Apparently something inside the keyboard that controls the top keys (which I regularly use) has simply died.  It's ridiculous to have to pay $50 a year for keyboards - there is no reason why they shouldn't last as long as the computer itself.

I tried it out. After two weeks, I went back to my old keyboard.

I chose to keep this keyboard instead of return it just so I would have a backup in case my old one dies (I am a graduate student and it's a recurring nightmare that my keyboard could die while I'm madly typing away on a paper at crunch time).

The dealbreaker is the sticky spacebar. It just doesn't depress easily on the right side with my right thumb. I have to use my left or exert much more pressure with my right to get the key to register. It made my hand hurt after a while. This is a major problem in an ergonomic keyboard.  I read the reviews and while several other people reported the same problem, I decided to buy it anyway, thinking that individual people may have gotten a defective unit. I can confirm now that the problem is widespread. It must be a design flaw and not a defective unit.

I'm going to be starting my dissertation soon and I can tell the extra height attachment is going to be really helpful for all that writing! There are a couple things that aren't perfect about this keyboard: 1) the space bar is a little stiff, but I don't notice it much when I'm typing along--I think it's only when I strike it in a certain way 2) With the extra height addition installed, it won't fit under my desk when I push the keyboard tray in--not a huge deal so far, but I know it will be annoying going forward; however, I'd rather have the extra height and deal with the inconvenience of it only fitting half way under my desk, plus that part is removable if it gets really annoying 3) It's apparently not available in a wireless version anymore, which means that if you really want it in wireless, you have to pay about $300 for it (that's the Microsoft 7000, from what I can tell).

It has 2 flaws:

1) The letters/numbers rub off the keys, and relatively quickly. This will make the keyboard unusable for those who 'hunt & peck'. But if you type from key memory, it's not really much of an issue.

2) And this is the BIG flaw... It's more sensitive to moisture than any other piece of electronics I've ever owned. Anyone who's used computers for a long time has at some point dumped a full cup of something onto their keyboard. I've done it more often than I care to admit. Other keyboards I've owned were surprisingly forgiving about this kind of thing, and usually go back to working ok once they dry out. In contrast: The MS4000 keyboard will be completely bricked if you get even a few drops of moisture between the keys. And I mean anywhere, between any of the keys, the whole keyboard is kind of a timebomb waiting for a few drops of moisture to commit sepuku with. Considering how a keyboard is made, you'd almost have to deliberately try to make something as sensitive to moisture as the ms4000.

This assessment is based on owning 3 (three) ms4000 keyboards over the past 7 years. I'm currently typing on a $10 logitech entry level keyboard which is no where near as comfortable to use. I'd much rather be typing on an ms4000, but I'm getting really sick of the built-in obsolescence in them. Toying with the idea of rearranging my desk area to allow a completely separate surface for drinks... but I'm kind of irked at MS for making the ms4000 so sensitive to moisture touching it in any way, that it almost has to be deliberate. Seriously, even having a window open overnight might provide enough chance for dew formation to brick these things.

After YEARS of use, they are old, discolored, and grimy. After my coworkers commented on how grimy they are, I finally decided to purchase this keyboard as a replacement.

I prefer the key layout that features the 2x3 Insert/Home/Delete/End keypad and the mostly horizontal arrow keys. Several manufacturers of other natural keyboards like to stack these keys up. I'm happy to say the original key layout is used on this keyboard (which you can see in the pictures).

The key press on this keyboard is much quieter than the MS Natural Pro was, but the key presses are still authoritative and confident. The note has moved from a ""clickety-clack"" to more of a low ""thunk."" If you're on a solid desk, it makes nearly no noise at all. One of my desks is a bar-height wall mount, so the thunk is a little louder there, but this is in no way a show stopper. The space bar is the loudest key.

I've read a lot of other reviews about the space bar being hard to press. Initially, I definitely noticed a slight difference. After a day's use, either the space bar has ""broken in,"" or I simply don't notice it any more. Again, not a show stopper.

If you're transitioning from a ""normal"" keyboard to a ""natural"" one, I highly encourage it. It will take a few days to adjust to the new layout, but it is much easier on your wrists and hands (must try it to believe it). If you're a ""hunt and peck typist,"" you're not going to benefit from this much.

The raised front is weird at first, but I was completely used to it and the split keyboard after about 1 week.

The general design is nice. I'm a fan of the concept of including some tilt and splitting the keys to make it possible to hold your hands in a fairly relaxed position. The physical build of the keyboard itself just didn't seem to be quite up to par with the price. I've been using the one I have now for several months and the space bar has never really felt great. I got used to it and I adjust for it now, but it's just now quite as easy to press down smoothly as the ones I've had on other keyboards. It feels like it has too much wiggle room.

At its current prices, though, it's not hugely more expensive than the really rock bottom cheap keyboards that don't have any ergonomic features. If you're doing an awful lot of typing (which happens to me at times) this is definitely worth it.

A big downside you should note is that this thing is pretty darn big. It's a full-sized keyboard with the number pad to the side, plus extra height and width added for the ergonomic features. If you have your keyboard tray in a tight space or very limited room on your desk, that might be an issue.

This also has a bunch of smart feature keys, but honestly their responsiveness seems to vary. The ones that pop open windows do great, but the volume keys are often very slow to do anything (on a Win 7 computer). I truly don't know if it's interference with something else installed on my machine, or if it's just something about how the keyboard drivers get along with Win 7. I've basically just given up on hitting those buttons.

On the whole, if you want a keyboard that has some ergonomics going for it and isn't hugely expensive (for example, if you have a history of spilling drinks on keyboards and don't want to put $100 into one) this is a good option.

If you need something wireless, or small, or you don't do much typing and don't want to adjust to a slightly modified layout (keys are in the same spots relative to each other, but that split in the middle takes a little adjustment for your muscle memory) you should look at something else.",Well Worth Its 2013-Price,1387324800,

As you probably know, the keyboard holds your hands in a much more ""natural"" position that puts less strain on your wrists. Seriously, look down and see how cramped your hands are right now. This fixes all of that.

Some major cons to this keyboard though:

- WPM went down considerably. I constantly hit the wrong keys. This is even after years of using natural keyboards
- Space bar problems persist. At other reviewers complain, the space bar sucks big time. First, it was completely stuck and wouldn't depress. I bashed it in  a few times and it loudly popped before working. It still never felt 'right' and I had many mis-types because of it.
- Questionable use of extra keys. Like that big ""throttle"" in the middle. It's only job seems to be to zoom in on images or webpages (not that useful really). I'd love to be able to customize this for video games or a certain task. Imagine being able to resize the entire window up or down with a flick or two. Or scroll through your available programs. Or flip through your inventory of items in FPS or RPG games. It just seems like a massive waste that is 0% customizable.

I still liked the product, and so did my wrists. I did try to fix it by opening it up and washing it. Let me tell you, it's a pretty complex piece of machinery for just a keyboard. You definitely are getting your money's worth.","Natural position feels ""right"", minor quirks",1387324800,

My hands are slender by my fingers are a little longer than average.  I am an excellent touch typist.  My hands are strong and agile but sometimes plagued with repetitive motion pains.

I'm a writer and editor, which means that I practically live in front of my keyboard.  The reason I started looking into ergonomic keyboards in the first place was that I was having repetitive motion problems in all of my fingers and other issues with my wrists are arms.  It was getting so bad that I pretty much couldn't type at all.

And then I got this keyboard.

Cons:
-bulkiness.  It will completely fill a normal keyboard tray, leaving no room for the mouse unless you can really squeeze it in (which I do).  But frankly, that's going to happen with any ergonomic keyboard.

Pros:
- It does what it's supposed to.  I've had the keyboard for about eight months now and can type all day without damaging my fingers.  Even when I've been having repetitive motion problems from my mouse (sigh), I can usually type without pain.  The wrist support is at exactly the right level and the way the keyboard is angled is supremely comfortable.

- It lasts (at least, so far).  After eight months, not only does the keyboard still function exactly as it ought to, I had to look closely in full sunlight to spot any wear on the keys.  In those eight months, I have typed well over a hundred thousand words.

Other comments:
- I've seen some people comment that the space bar is a little harder than on some keyboards.  Of course, to some extent, all external keyboards will have harder space bars than laptops, but it's true that this one took a little adjustment for me.  And by a little, I mean about a week.  Now, I don't notice at all.  The one time it's a problem is when one needs extreme space bar precision.  I place Guild Wars 2, in which there are jumping puzzles, and one must jump -- using the space bar -- at exact and sensitive moments.  For the most difficult of these jumping puzzles, I have to use my laptop space bar instead because I can't be exact enough with this one.",My fingers are grateful.,1387152000,

I removed the plastic frame in the front that put the keyboard at an unnatural angle, but if I were using a keyboard tray it would probably work better with it.  The reason for giving it only 3 stars has to do with the orientation of the number keys on top.  (Not the keyboard on the right.)  I was a statistical typist for many years on both electric typewriters and computers before the advent of the separate number keys evolved.  Consequently, I never use the number pad.

When Microsoft developed this keyboard, which was probably done by younger people who grew up learning to use the number pad, they divided the numbers incorrectly.  The number 6 should be on the top left side of the right hand but they have placed it on the top right of the left side next to the 5 and the right hand number keys start with the number 7.  This throws off not only my typing of numbers, but also the rest of the symbols over the numbers.  I suppose I will get used to this configuration after a while, but for the moment I find myself making lots of errors on numbers and things like $, @, #, etc.

If you can live with this inconvenience, this is an excellent keyboard.  The shortcut keys for favorites, home, mail, volume, etc. are quick and easy to use.

I've been using this keyboard for more than 6 years of not longer. Now it's the 2nd one, the first one was damaged by some tea flooding :) I'm a computer programmer, so a good keyboard to keep me from any wrist problem is a must.

So, the most important feature of this keyboard is the front riser! That will keep you from wrist problems.
I think many user feel it awkward and discard it right the way.
The front riser keeps your wrist flat, flat on the backside of your wrist I mean or even a naturally slightly bending down. If flat on the palm side actually you're bending your wrist upward. Bending your wrist up for long in doing work is bad, very bad.
Without the front riser, it becomes more a regular ergonomic keyboard.

It's also comfortable but you will need to adjust to this keyboard as it is VERY DIFFERENT than other keyboards you have used, especially if you use only those flat, tiny-keys, non-split keyboard.
You have to adjust to this keyboard, discard your bad posture, not the keyboard will adjust for you.

It has a design since 2005, check how many keyboard design have survived this long and have so many followers?
It's a functionally design without modern gimmicks.
My biggest complaint is the 6 key is in the wrong left location. Trained typist should knows6 should be a right hand key.

It's loud and heavy to press in modern standard, but some people prefer that for a greater feedback feel. I came from the days of using mechanical keyboards and used real typewriters when I first learn typing, so those are not problems to me.

I don't use hot keys much other than the old fashion F2 to rename file, Alt-F4 to close windows, Ctrl-C/V to cut and paste and some other Fn keys as every programmers do. So I'm not sure what the complaints of the hotkeys are about. I contrast, I do find some new keyboards have the Fn keys default to media functions very troublesome.

There is a new Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard which also have front riser that should have addressed most complaints. I haven't tried that but only the Sculpt Comfort one, the keys are lighter and quieter.",Functional great old design to protect your wrist without modern gimmicks.,1386288000,

Pressing down is not smooth or easy, in fact all the keys on the board require a degree of effort that seems against the idea of 'Ergonomic.' When resting my palms on the fat black cushion while typing there's pain, which is natural due to that's not how one should type, but the inclusion of this big fat area, below the wrists when typing, would lead one to believe that that is how one should type. I suggest having more prominent literature and illustrations with keyboard. It's been awhile since I opened the box and forgot instructions came with it. BIG and VISUALLY INSTRUCTIVE proper use is necessary. Don't use words, use pictures and drawings.

A revision should be considered. Pressing down keys should be effortless, not taxing on the fingers. The spacebar sticks, I popped it open and found a nipple of plastic, leftover from the injection mold I assume, pressing against the northern wall of the keyboard, below the center black wheel with the plus and minus on it.

The design is really nice, with the split keyboard being an increasingly rare thing to find these days. Almost no models made by anyone offer such a design, but even if there was more competition of this type, I still think this keyboard is great.

The programmable buttons (MANY of them) are a huge plus. You can program most of them to do all kinds of things, including opening often-used documents or websites for you, or running macros you write.

The buttons that are intended for specific purposes, though, are so well thought-out that I leave most of the button assignments as they are. For example, the buttons dedicated for increasing, decreasing, or muting the speaker/headphone volume are VERY useful very often. And the calculator button also gets a lot of use. Others are the same: very well-thought-out standard assignments doing things I do often (and that presumably most people do often), and once you get used to the fact that now you have a button that does what you want (at first, you'll do it the slower way requiring many more button presses &/or mouse pointer clicks), this keyboards full functionality really shines through for you, and you can't imagine how you could use anything else!

The removable palm rest is another great feature, by the way. Since I use this on my lap, and the bottom of that thing isn't comfortable at all that way, I'm very happy it comes off. And it goes on and off very quickly and easily, in case you want to move it back and forth between a non-organic surface and your lap.

The only problem I have with this keyboard in its wireless version (I have both cabled and wireless ones) is that with many positions I get in, even when the keyboard is VERY close to the receiver plugged into the USB jack on the front of my computer, it won't work at all many times. But when the keyboard is in other positions that have NO line of sight to the receiver, it works fine. It's very particular that way, with some orientations that seem like they'd make for very easy connectivity being impossible to use, while other orientations/distances that seem like they wouldn't work work just fine. Go figure. But once you learn its oddities, you can work around that by moving the keyboard and/or the receiver plugged into the computer so that it works. I do still find it annoying that it seems like the most comfortable positions I want to be in often seem impossible to make work, even with very close proximity. Using the wired version, of course, removes this problem entirely. But I think that the connectivity of the wireless version should not be so touchy and idiosyncratic, and would describe it as a ""design flaw."" I would have to say that, overall, this isn't enough to warrant deducting a star, though.

Overall, though, I'd say it's a great keyboard, and highly recommend it.","Wonderful keyboard, VERYuseful programmable buttons aplenty. Only problem: Intermittent connectivity problem with wireless unit.",1384560000,

After about one week of not-very-intense use I had to stop using this apparently well made but horribly designed keyboard.  The use of my right hand and arm became painful.  There were three main problems:

#1 The amount of thumb pressure required to actually register the ""space"" key was way too much to type with any comfort or confidence.  Even if I concentrated on always striking the space key so that a space would be inserted into the text or computer code where needed, I found that about 1-in-12 or 1-in-14 attempted spaces would not be inserted.  It is terrible that part of one's brain must focus on striking the space key with heavy force; it is even worse that one must proof read each page of text or code to ensure that spaces have been inserted where needed.

#2 The space key is intrinsically badly designed anyway, because one wants this key to be equally welcoming to both the left and right thumbs.  It isn't.  I found that my right thumb worked best, requiring unnatural contortions to ensure spaces were inserted where needed.

#3 In general, I found that the $10 keyboard Dell included with my latest XPS desktop requires a more comfortable amount of force for ALL of the keys, not just the space key.  This could be because the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Business requires greater downward movement of the keys for a stroke to be registered.

Problems #1 and #2 are so severe that I found this keyboard simply unusable.  This is quite an indictment for a way-above-average-cost keyboard that is allegedly designed and built with proper ergonomics in mind.  I am astounded that so many users find this a comfortable keyboard.  By the way, during more than half of my PC and computer keyboard use, which dates back to the late 1970s, I have actually used (and preferred) Logitech and especially Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.  This is the first ergonomic keyboard I have ever used that I have found to be a thinly disguised implement of torture for thumb, hand, and arm.

I now have some appreciation for the feelings of the other one-star and two-star reviewers when they read the patronizing remarks of the many keyboarders who find this device comfortable.  Some seem to pooh-pooh (usually in patronizing terms) those of us who find this one of the most wretched keyboards we have ever encountered.  It is a little hard to believe we sufferers happened to receive slightly defective devices.  The complaint I offer can be found too often in the reviews for our complaint to occur as a result of a minor or rare manufacturing defect.

I have been using a Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000 for many years. It has served me well, and I can type really fast on it. I don't measure my WPMs but I type considerably fast you'll just have to take my word for it. I bought this keyboard thinking it would be the next iteration. Newer = better, right? I was sorely mistaken. I gave it a week and I hate this board, and I am willing to bet you will too, unless your hand is already severely deformed in a matching arc to fit this keyboard.

PROs:
It's a keyboard, and has tons of multimedia buttons. The full number pad worked well, but that's because Microsoft didn't try to do anything fancy with it. It's sleek, shiny, and black and not polka dotted or striped. And the wrist rest is some super lush exotic material that feels softer than a baby's bottom. But, that's about it for pros.

CONs:
As mentioned throughout the other reviews here, this keyboard has a really crappy space bar. I read this and thought maybe it wouldn't bother me, but it did. Not only is the space bar really hard to push down, but when you do it makes a really loud sound that is not a click, or a push, but a really unnatural sound as if you are breaking the button. I obviously did not wear the keyboard in to see if this went away but other reviews don't mention it going away.

I am a gamer. I hear you judging me, ""So why buy an ergonomic keyboard then?"" Well, I'm also a web programmer. (And btw the Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard was amazing and was NOT uncomfortable for gaming.) Anyway, the positioning of the WASD keys is perfect. However, if you are in a game where you need CTRL, SHIFT, or the space bar, you may run into issues. I had difficulty hitting those keys properly. And in a game where I had to hold ALT to run, the key did not register properly. I had to remove my hands from other keys so I could push down on ALT with all of my might in order for it to register and stay down.

I also have another issue. I'm including it, but not blaming it on the keyboard. It's apparently just a typing ""quirk"" that I have. I find that I hit a few keys ""improperly"" such as I hit the B key with my left hand. Doesn't seem that I always do this, but I apparently do it enough and with this keyboard it is impossible to do. I get that it forces you to type properly, but I don't like to conform, and I just couldn't get used to this change.

The multimedia keys were great. Except it is impossible to hit any of them reliably. You will have to turn on a light to be able to distinguish them. And, if your keyboard is on a keyboard tray like mine, that means pulling it out all the way to be able to get to those keys. (This is a big, clunky keyboard.) Not to mention, for you keyboard tray users, make sure that the arc will fit under your keyboard tray. The keyboard comes with an attachable foot to raise it up, but this raises the keyboard up so high that it won't fit under the desk. Also, I found that it raised the keyboard at such an odd angle, that it was as if you were trying to type with a wall in front of you. You know when your cat is in front of you and you're trying to keep typing while arcing your arms over the cat's back? Yeah, that's what this feels like. And you don't get the adorable cat.

Other questionable decisions: I didn't like that the F1-F12 keys all had the numbers hidden on the recessed side of the key instead of the face. And the ESC key seemed to be floating on an island where it was difficult to press. Oh and the CAPS lock and SCROLL lock lights being right at the front, well it was kind of annoying to have them shining there constantly. I like them at the top of a keyboard so I can push them under the desk ledge and not have to see them.

Overall this was a horrible decision. The 2000 keyboard series is not being made anymore, so I am going to try the 3000 and hope it is better. Until then, I type on a Logitech mini keyboard and my hands hurt like hell. OW!",Eww just ew,1383350400,

Disassemble the keyboard.
Remove all screws on the bottom.
Remove two resting pads for your wrist.
Remove space bar, be careful.. it just requires a little prying but don't be too aggressive.
Remove two screws underneath the space bar and two screws that were underneath the wrist pads.
Remove front panel with all keys attached.

Look for the mainboard inside the assembly.
Remove three screws + 1 screw holding on mainboard assembly.
You'll notice a bunch of lines on the bottom of the mainboard and lines on the plastic as well.
It seems that these lines became unaligned on my assembly and with some adjustment it just began working again.
Make sure you check that all keys are working before putting all screws in (it would be good to have a couple of them in to keep it from falling apart)

The keys were loose and somewhat mushy, traveling slightly from side to side when being pressed down because the caps were not on too well.

The keyboard has a few fatal flaws for people with RSI. The first, and least serious of them, is the difficulty in pressing some keys (the chief culprit here is the Space bar). A few keys require an inordinate amount of pressure to properly depress.

The second flaw is the size of the right-hand set of keys. They take up a large amount of your desk real estate which, in turn, means that reaching over to the mouse (or trackball in my case) requires more of an effort than with a regular keyboard. This puts more stress on the wrist, which is the exact opposite of what you would want in an ergonomic keyboard.

Finally, the ""F-lock"" feature really bothers me. This ""feature"" means that the function keys (F1 through F12) are not enabled until you press the F-lock key. And you have to press it during every user session (e.g. every reboot, every wake from sleep or hibernation) in order for the function keys to be enabled. Very aggravating.

The programmability of the keyboard is a nice feature but, of course, was not one of the critical features I was looking for in an ergonomic keyboard. I would have to suggest you look elsewhere if you are in search of an ergonomic keyboard.",Not good for ergonomic purposes,1379721600,

- Nice keyboard.

CONS:
- A broken key. (I understand this could happen)
- Warranty replacement requires shipping the defective unit at *my cost* (I don't understand this)

I've been a fan of MS Natural ergonomic keyboard since late 90's. It helped a lot when I had carpal tunnel syndrome back then, and I've been buying one every 3 years or so.

This is the first black one (not gray) that I got. Some warned me about poor responsibility of the space bar. It was OK. But after a month and a half after the purchase, I found the ""b"" key was not being responsive. I had to press it all the way in for it to register, unlike other keys that require only light push. Shame on me for noticing this so late, after all the mysterious typos. (I had thought my touch typing just got more lame)

Since I missed the window to return this to Amazon, I called MS customer service, which I usually dread for any company. The call got answered in a few minutes and the talk went smooth. But in the end, they wanted it to be shipped to them at *my cost* before sending me a replacement. Maybe it's the current industry standard practice but I found that pretty bad one.

I ended up doing some physical hacking and doing my own fix.
If I'm not happy with that hack, maybe I will buy a new one, not bothering with shipping it back.
Come on, shipping it back is ~$10 shipping plus finding correct boxes and trips to/from the shipping place. Easier to shell out another $30 for a new product (which I will make sure working in the first week!).","Broken ""b"" key. Customer has to pay shipping to get warranty replacement from MS.

But since it was already on the way, I decided to just give it a try.  I wanted to replace my vintage Natural Elite PS/2, which finally failed in a way I couldn't fix it.

It arrived and, of course, I found the space bar impossible.  But I decided to persist and give it a fair trial. I remember when I had to switch back from the natural elite to the flat, my typing sucked for a few weeks

A week later... its as good as my natural elite was and I'm quite happy.  I do occasionally hit random key strokes as my pace increases, but I attribute that to it being a totally different form factor than the regular flat board I've used the last year (yeah, I procrastinated on replacing my natural elite).  I anticipate that getting better as my hands get used to the difference in keyboard.

For anyone ""on the fence"", bear in mind your hand has to get used to the changes to the keyboard.  How quickly depends on how much you type and how fast.  It probably also depends on posture, ergonomics and age (but I'm not a doctor so I can't speak to that specifically - just my experience).  Don't write the keyboard off before giving it a good solid few weeks to a month to get comfortable with.

This is not very pretty, especially compared to the imac, but my carpal tunnel / tendentious got soooo bad, I had to do everything that I possible could to relieve some pain. This keyboard did help with my carpal tunnel pain, but it started to not work at all after a few months. I had to unplug the usb connector a couple times at first, and it seemed to work well again. But it started getting glitchy here and there after that. So, it is not terrible, but I do expect a product like this to work smoothly for at least a couple years. But-- surprisingly, it did help me with hand / wrist pain.

I actually live with extremely severe fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs) and it has left me with an enormously sensitive body, always in pain and unbearable exhaustion, without relief. So, I really know the difference between placebo effect and actual, real physical relief. Along with this keyboard, I really struggled with finding the best ergonomic mouse. What I ended up realizing is that TWO MOUSE devices were the best for carpal tunnel pain issues. Here is the reason:

Repetitive movement and positioning is what hurts the hands / wrists / arms so much. So-- If you constantly switch your hand / wrist positioning, you don't give the carpel tunnel channel enough time to start swelling and then pinching and then that horrible stabbing pain.. I had gotten to the point where brushing my teeth or holding a mug was unbearable. It was very scary, and honestly, depressing! It all started in early adulthood as well, which was especially depressing on many levels for me. I went to hand therapists, I had physical therapy, everything.. Still, I had so much pain. Now, after switching my desk equipment, I am 95% pain free! I seriously SERIOUSLY never thought that I would get pain relief. The key is to have an ergonomic keyboard (the slight difference in angle is enormous) and to have two differently-shaped ergonomic mouse devices connected all side-by-side.

Here is the more expensive mouse that I purchased from Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3M-Ergonomic-Mouse-Optical-USB-PS2-Compatible-Small-Size-Black-EM500GPS/dp/B000F2BP7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3M Ergonomic Mouse, Optical, USB/PS2 Compatible, Small Size, Black (EM500GPS)</a>&nbsp;*Be aware of the size for your needs!

One other random thing that helps me, is something that is an all natural supplement used as a natural allergy treatment alternative. It is called D-Hist, and it uses a few all natural anti-inflammatory ingredients. The side bonus is that it helps with pain in the entire body -- and helps with allergies (at least for me. I had never heard of it before Amazon) Here is a link to D-Hist as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ortho-Molecular-Product-Natural-D-Hist-120-Capsules/dp/B0006ON6D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ortho Molecular Product Natural D-Hist -- 120 Capsules</a>

Pickering,"I bought this keyboard 7 years ago when I started getting repetitive stress injuries(RSIs) in my wrists.  The combination of angled keys, wrist support, and negative tilt (decline) allowed my wrists to heal once the stresses of the old keyboard were removed.  See bottom of review for keyboard posture information.

The keyboard layout has some nuances to it, the ""enter"" and ""shift"" keys on the right hand are slightly smaller than normal, and the T/G/H/N keys are a bit larger than normal.

Once you get used to it the layout is great and promotes good typing habits.

The mute/volume/calculator buttons are really helpful.

When it broke a few years back, I ordered another.
It had a serious issue - the space bar was so hard to push that I had to whack it so hard my wife could hear me from downstairs.  In fact, all the keys were difficult to push.

I sent it back, and tried a few other models for a few years, none of which worked as well for me as the microsoft ergo.  I'm 6'2"" and have quite large hands, the generous wrist support area is key as it allows my wrists to be completely relaxed.

I ordered another out of desperation last year, fortunately microsoft must have listened to the complaints because the keys are much easier to depress, much like the original board i had from 2006.

I'm stoked to have my favorite ergo keyboard back.  When combined with good postural habits it will keep you RSI free even if you spend countless hours a day at your computer.

------------------------------
******posture info******
------------------------------

Overall posture plays a huge role in how well or poorly your wrists and hands will handle any keyboard.

Arms should be relaxed, straight down from the shoulders, with elbows bent at 90 degrees or wider.

Keyboard should be directly in front of you, with arms pointed in towards each other slightly so the wrists can be straight, not bent to the left or right.  The curved keyboard promotes this.

Wrists should extend straight out from forearms, or be tilted slightly down, resting gently on the keyboard.

Depress the keys using only enough pressure to click it completely, avoid ""pounding"" the keyboard.

If there is tension in any of the muscles of your hands, wrists, arms, or upper back, eventually you will develop an RSI.

Simply put, the 4000 is wonderful to type with.  I particularly like how the keyboard includes the removable elevator for the heel of your hands.  At first, it's a little awkward having a keyboard that slopes slightly downward, but I've found I actually prefer this arrangement to the original natural keyboard.  If you don't like it, it's removable so you can have it set up just like the original.

The keyboard makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel.  The arrow keys are inverted-T arrangement, the F keys are large and easy to press, and the number keypad is top-notch.  There is just enough positive feedback when pressing the keys to make effective touch typing easy.

I type 150 wpm on a slow day and I've got one of these at both my offices and at my home.  It's corded, so no batteries to replace.  It looks different and always catches everyone's attention when they see it on your desk.

I intend on stockpiling these for future use, just as I did when the original natural keyboard was discontinued.  For the money, I think this is the best keyboard on the market.

This keyboard is NOT for people who cannot touch type.  If you are looking at your keyboard to type, you need to stay with a regular one or take some keyboarding classes.  The split layout is wonderful on the wrists, but a disaster for those who have to hunt-and-peck.  I find they're the ones who are most critical of this layout whereas the folks who touch type seem to like these.

If you're new to the split layout altogether, just give it a week and you'll find your accuracy improving and your comfort level and wrist pain dimished dramatically.

It has a direct button for calculator which I use very often. It has 5 programmable buttons and a favorites buttons. At my work I have these programmed for various scripts and at home, I use them for resmon.exe etc for performance analysis. These are very useful features for programmers and gamers. I have also gamed a lot on this keyboard. I am left handed and use arrow keys instead of WASD, So I didn't notice any limitations. The old versions of these keyboards had a very bad spacebar.

I purchased 2 more Microsoft 4000 keyboards, one for him and one as a backup. He stopped complaining and said that the keyboard helped.

I tried this one because I couldn't find the Microsoft Elite (heavy duty white keyboard). It's been around for 15+ years and it ""NEVER breaks"" and once you get used to it you can go 100wpm+.

I couldn't type on this ""low budget and planned for a short lifetime"" keyboard because of the defect in the space-bar.

You can't press the spacebar with normal typing pressure. You have to Bang on it or press it with 2 fingers. Apparantly this has become common knowledge on the web but I haven't heard anything from Microsoft about a fix.

This product should NOT have been released like that. I've found a few people using it, but they're new to computers and typing and they don't realize how bad it is. Try typing on one at a Wal-Mart or Best Buy and feel the space bar design problems.

Initially when I bought this keyboard (years ago) I thought I'd have trouble adapting but it definitely is comfy, especially the wrist rests. Makes all of the difference. I won't use anything else on any of my home computers unless I am forced to (when it breaks)

My only gripe with this keyboard is the CLEANING. Good lord. Let me preface this by saying I am very careful taking apart electronics, I dismantle computers and other electronics as well as build them. This thing just HATES to be touched. I have owned 2 of these, and the only time they stop working is when I pull them apart to clean it.

My first one I pulled apart and cleaned, but about half the keys stopped working for no reason. Albeit I may have touched the tracers leading to the keys and other things, but I wasn't rough with it nor pulled things apart.

My second one, I had got so filthy I couldn't stand it, (a few days ago) so I took it apart. I never touched a single piece of the electronic hardware. (Note: When you unscrew the bottom, the key top part separates from the bottom part with all the hardware, so you can just clean the top part without messing with the bottom part) I spent a good 2-3 hours taking the keys off one by one, putting them in warm soapy water, then cleaning them, letting them dry, and re-assembling them. I blew some canned air on the bottom part (underneath the electronics where the dust settles) and then put it back together. Mission accomplished! Except the keyboard was now recognized as a Ergonomic 2000 and none of the keys worked. (Lights did come on)

My only complaint with the layout and feel of the keyboard is that the right space bar can be very stiff, which is moderately annoying. The problem I have is that the keyboard doesn't work on either my desktop or on my laptop.

I ordered one from Amazon, plugged it directly into my desktop, and booted. It worked fine with the Windows boot manager, but once Windows 7 64 came up, it was completely dead. A little research online showed me that others have had problems getting their PC to recognize the keyboard, so I tried plugging it into my laptop to see if it was a compatibility issue. Didn't work with my new Lenovo T430 running Windows 7 64, either. Looked online, and all the Microsoft support site was effectively useless. It focused on making sure that I had the keyboard plugged in correctly, and had me re-download and re-install the Windows multimedia keyboard drivers/app. I did all that, but the installs always failed to recognize the keyboard. In Device Manager, the keyboard shows as attached, but says the drivers cannot be found. It looked like I got a bad keyboard.

Amazon was great about returning the keyboard for a new one.

The new keyboard came, but once again it didn't work with my desktop. It did work with my laptop, though...until I rebooted it. Then it just stopped working with the laptop, also. Went through the re-installation drill again on both machines. Same symptoms, same results. No joy.

I've given up on this device. Apparently it works for most PCs, or there'd be a lot more reviews like this one, but it is not universally compatible, and to my knowledge there's no way to tell if it will work for your PC or not.

I was very disappointed when they discontinued that model and replaced it with one that was much more cheaply made and only had rear risers. When I found the they had released the Natural Keyboard 4000 I was very excited. Well, about as excited as you can get about keyboards. How much do I love this keyboard? I just relocated from the US to Singapore, and I made sure to pack one to take with me to use at the office.

I have two of them - one for home and one for the office. They're very comfortable to type on, and I believe I'm a much faster typer when I use them. They're also very well built. I've been banging away on the one at the office for about five years so far and aside from the tops of the keys wearing smooth and the key labels wearing away they function perfectly. The rear risers make my wrists happy, as does the wrist rest pad.

I think my only concern will be the longevity of the wrist rest padding. The original Microsoft Natural keyboard had a hard plastic wrist rest that was just as durable as you'd expect hard plastic to be, while the 4000 has a padded rest. It's more comfortable, but at the cost of durability.

However, I loved the keyboard layout, and the front riser. Basically, there's a little lift you can use to prop up the front of the keyboard. It's takes some getting used to since most people prop up the rear of the keyboard.

Turns out, for your wrists, it's better to have the front lifted up, rather than the rear.

The special buttons are easy to program. Another review mentioned that you couldn't program the 'Web Browser"" button to launch something other that IE. Not for me. You can very easily change it to launch Chrome or anything else. The ""control panel"" for it is very easy and intuitive.

Anyways, by this one. The USB version. IT's half the price of the wireless version, and you'll never lose keystrokes.

As other reviewers have noted, the space bar is terrible, to the point of being unusable. There is simply no excuse for this. The spacebar has to be hit almost dead center or it binds up. This means you almost always have to take your fingers off the home keys in order to strike it properly.

That alone is enough to warrant the one star review, but it gets worse.

The alphanumeric keys are spaced too close together. The overall feel of the keys is simply horrible. There is little or no tactile feedback when depressing a key. The keycaps are so wobbly it feels like they're going to come off. Keys bind when being depressed just a bit off center.

I settled on this model, thinking it would fit the bill for my home office.  When I got the unit, I was immediately surprised and dismayed, because I could not tell from the picture that the keyboard is wavy on the vertical axis.  I know it is described as an ergonomic keyboard, so that is partially my fault, but it has wrist support, and the keys appear to be arced on the horizontal axis, so I thought that was where the ergonomics started and stopped.  Not so.  The keyboard has a VERY prominent hump where the home row keys are split, and the space bar falls on this split.  I'm sure there are many people who can take to this type of layout right away and wonder what their hands have been missing their whole lives, but not I.  In addition to the hump making it feel very awkward like I had never typed before, but also the spaebar is centered squarely on the hump, with only one point of actuation on the hump, so if you don't take extra care to press down deliberately hard, close to the center, the spacebar won't register a keystroke.  If I had to write this review with that keyboard, it would have taken me 20 minutes because I would have to backspace and then peck at the spacebar with my index finger, novice typist style, to make sure it registers a keystroke.  The combination of the hump and the difficult to press spacebar made me decide within about 3 minutes that I couldn't keep the keyboard.

The other replaced the Adesso TruForm that was given to me by my company as an ergo board when my first Natural Elite outright died. It just wouldn't come up at all...

The good.
- Key layout similar to the Natural Elite. Hand and wrist position more or less unchanged.
- Not white. I liked my Natural, and wanted a black one when everything changed from white to black. This board is actually fairly attractive.
- Angle adjustment options. The riser on the front is removeable, there are feet under the back, so you can raise the entire thing, raise just the front, just the back, or set it level. Depending on how my hands / arms feel on a given day, I keep mine either level, or rear raised.
- Overall good tactile feel to the keys. A little softer than the Natural, a LOT softer than the Addesso.
- None of the keys stick. The left shift key on the Addesso sticks, ALL the time, that can be a problem when coding, or typing up long documents.
- Gel cushioned wrist rests.
- The standard keys / buttons at least, work with a KVM switch no problem.

The bad.
- First and foremost, it's not a black version of the Natural Keyboard Elite. For better or worse that board is gone. I loved my Elites, and would happily have gotten new ones.
- The space bar on the right side takes more pressure than any other key to actuate on one of the boards. It is loosening up as I use it, but it does slow my typing down a bit.

The weird.
- Front riser block thing a ma jig. I am not sure how that could be comfortable to use. I took them off of both boards and set them aside. Seems like a HUGE waste of plastic to me.
- No included driver software, but the extended functions like the Zoom slider don't work on Windows XP without an added driver. Haven't tried it on Windows 7 or Linux yet. Some of the buttons work, some don't. The little flyer in the box does a LOUSY job of explaining it.

Summary.
- Contstruction quality slightly below the older boards, but still far above the competing current boards.
- Good feel when typing.
- Sticky / too much pressure space bar out of the box is annoying. But seems to wear in fairly quickly.

I have a need for 2 other keyboards, 1 for another desktop and 1 for a laptop docking station at home. I will be buying these boards again for those applications. If it weren't for the sticky spacebar, and missing driver CD I would have given this board 5 stars.

***UPDATE 8/6/2013***
After less than 4 months of use, the one of these I took to work (I bought two, one for home, one for the office), the letter printing on my E key is almost completely gone, and the other keys are rapidly wearing.

I used it to replace a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. The wrist/palm rests feel very nice, and I like the fact that the keys are quiet - I'm trying to train myself to take notes while on the phone using the computer instead of using a pad of paper, and I find that loud typing while I'm talking on the phone can interfere with my hearing the other person, and with their perception of my attention. The software does seem relatively Spartan but to be honest I'm not a big user of customization features, so it doesn't impact my use of the device. In the past, I haven't even bothered to install keyboard driver software. The zoom feature works nicely in Firefox, I don't use IE much.

So, for my use - standard typing for many hours/day, minimal use of special features - it's a great keyboard. I'm glad it's got the older-style cursor key/insert-delete-scroll key setup, rather than the setup used on the Natural Elite, that I never did really

While today's keyboards aren't as horrible as some of my youth--here's looking at you, Commodore 64!--they nonetheless can cause various maladies to development if used constantly.  In my line of work as a network administrator and full-time family tech support geek I'm typing quite a lot, and I remember seeing Microsoft's announcement about their new ""Natural"" Keyboard, back around 1994 or 1995.  I laughed at it--it looked silly, what with the split down the middle and the angling of the keys on each side.  It was as if Dali had spoken to someone at Microsoft and won the bet in a bar...

Right.  Well, around 1998 I started getting both numbness and painful cramping in my wrists and hands.  Guess what?  I ended up trying that original, bizarre Natural keyboard and it was TOUGH.  Took a great deal of training, trying to re-acclimate my hands to where the keys had been moved, and my typing speed hit a brick wall during the process.  Thankfully, however, after untold Mavis Beacon sessions and lessening pain and numbness, I persevered.

I now use this current model, the MS Natural Keyboard 4000, on all my desktop computers and laptops with docking stations.  I can attest firsthand the difference it has made in the quality of my life, given my line of work: I don't have to take pain medications constantly, I'm not relegated to using voice dictation software and suffering the speed and accuracy penalties often associated with it, and I don't dread long-term input sessions.

PRO's:
--Relatively inexpensive
--Not gaudy in appearance; black, grey, and silver colors don't stand out in a professional environment
--Keys are fairly quiet (although this could be a ""con""--see below)
--Wired - no batteries to replace or recharge!
--Numlock, Shiftlock and Capslock lights are centrally located and easily seen
--Integrated wrist rest is sloped just about right and uses a sort of anti-sweating material.  It works well for me.
--Most important feature: the angling ""in"" of the two halves of the keyboard allow the wrists to be more or less ""at ease"" when typing, resulting in lower stress on the joints and muscles when compared to traditional flat-across keyboards.

CON's:
--Keys are fairly quiet; if you want a keyboard with deafening clackety-clack audible and tactile feedback, this rubber-dome keyboard isn't for you.  Get an old IBM buckling springs one instead.
--Due to the rubber-dome nature of the construction, this keyboard won't last forever (unlike some of those old IBM keyboards mentioned above--wow).  However, that said, I type a great deal and still manage a good 3-4 years on these before I start having one or two keys fail to work 100% of the time.
--The retraining period isn't easy and may well take a bit longer than you'd expect; stick with it, though, and it's quite likely you just might end up typing _faster_ than on standard old keyboards--and hurting less, to boot!

BOTTOM LINE:
  It's a bit of a specialty market product, perhaps...  but if you're a person suffering from carpal tunnel/RTI or other issues around your wrists when you type, you owe it to yourself to at least try this style of keyboard.

So much research and engineering has gone into displays that their resolution is on par with the human eye. Granted there's more work to be done with color, contrast, and intensity but it's still arguably impressive, not to mention beautiful to look at.

So what about input? Touch displays got its kick start with the first iPhone and even Microsoft has seen the light with Windows 8. But touch displays suck for anything other than basic input. What about keyboards? If you type a lot (like me) this makes a big difference, even more if you actually type and don't ""peck."" I've always been at a loss by how complacent people are when it comes to keyboards. A cheap flat keyboard (usually the one that came with the computer) is the de-facto standard helped along with companies who give you a puzzled look when you ask for something better.

The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is better. It's also rather cheap, provides a good typing angle, both between your arms (allowing you to stick your elbows out) and between it and the desk surface (so you can avoid bending your hands backwards). I don't use the extra keys so I won't comment on their utility. The tactile feedback is soft, which I think allows for smoother typing rather than the mechanical typewriter style of making sure you press hard enough to make each letter legible on the paper. It also feels rather solid and comfortable, especially the padding at the bottom.

The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 will assuage concerns of carpal tunnel syndrome while providing some of the best typing you will ever experience on any keyboard ever made.

I've been using a 4000 since its initial release in 2003. It is the first keyboard I've ever owned that I have to replace because I WEAR IT OUT like running shoes.

* First Timers *

If you've never used a 4000 before, you'll find that there is a slight learning curve, even with experience with previous models of Microsoft Natural Keyboards. The incline which places your wrists in proper typing position (a position that few of us learned, much less execute properly). This typing position may feel odd at first, but prevents any onset of carpal tunnel syndrome - an unfortunate condition I refer to as the Career Ender for anyone in a profession where writing is a primary activity.

* Functionality *

In addition to being a splendid ergonomic keyboard, this is the first of Microsoft's lineup where I use the quick-access keys. A Play/Pause button interfaces with iTunes and other MP3 software without programming, the mute and volume buttons are outstanding, and I cannot tell you how useful a Calculator button is (which came as a surprise even to me that I would use it as often as I do).

* Overall *

I've bought a 4000 for every computer I've ever used (including when I worked at corporate locations where a 4000 wasn't provided). It's an invaluable piece of my daily computing, and I recommend it to anyone who is seeking an excellent ergonomic keyboard solution.

* About Me *

I type 125 words-per-minute without errors and write for a living. In other words, this review is written by a person who only puts their keyboards on light use - I am a heavy user and will break any keyboard I have over time (it's just the repetitive impact nature of the job). That being said, the 4000 holds up to heavy, unending use.

This keyboard, while more attractive than the older model, is much harder to use. The keys are a lot stiffer and control key commands are slow. On the Elite, you can pretty much press the control key and the alphabetic key at the same time. On this keyboard, you have to hold down the control key a brief moment before you press the other key. If you don't, unexpected errors occur - for instance if, when copying text, you hit the ""C"" key too quickly, it deletes the text and won't paste it when you hit ctrl-V.

The function keys can be used for internet scrolling, but since I primarily use my mouse for that, I just find that all the extra keys and functions clutter up the keypad. Plus, the letters are harder to see on a black background, although on the plus side, it doesn't get as dirty as the cream-colored Elite. And while, in theory the strip at the bottom of the keyboard ought to be more comfortable because of the padding, it isn't.

I could live with all the other issues if it weren't for the stiffness of the keys and the sluggishness of the response when using ctrl commands.

Aside from that, the keyboard looks great, and I loved the palm rest. But as a keyboard, where the Natural Elite excelled, this one failed. Ended up going with a Perrix as a close replacement for the Natural Elite.

I own three of these keyboards: one for my laptop at work, one for my desktop at home and a 2nd keyboard at home for the work laptop. The keyboard is comfortable and I especially appreciate the wrist rest. The option to elevate the front of the keyboard is an added plus, although I have to admit not using it considering my height and the heights of my chair and desk. For taller/shorter users it may provide the optimal angle.

The other bonus for this keyboard: the extra buttons along the top edge. The mute button is extremely useful at work. I've also programmed the ""My Favorites"" buttons for those programs I use all the time.

Installation via the USB plug is easy and it takes just a second or two for the system to recognize the keyboard (I'm running Windows 7).

One hint suggestion: Download the Microsoft IntelliType software - it makes setting up the keyboard and all those extra buttons a breeze. (Type Microsoft IntelliType into Google and select the
'Software Downloads | Microsoft Hardware' link. Select the 'Keyboards' tab then look for the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 link; or try cutting & pasting this: [...]).

Another useful tip: clean the wrist rest every other day - I use Clorox wipes. I've found this keeps the wrist rest clean and free of oils & dust (dead skin cells).

One other note regarding the issues that serveral users have experienced: The space bar is a bit stiff, but it loosened up after 2-3 weeks. I have noticed some fading of the letters, but this has only been after several years of daily use (I've had my work keyboard for almost three years). I have one keyboard crap out on me after a year (my home keyboard); one phone call to Microsoft had a replacement shipped out and I received it within a week.

Overall a great keyboard - if I had to pick one 'Con' I would say the keyboard itself has a rather large footprint (set aside at least an 11""x20"" area on your desk). Considering the usefulness of the wrist rest and the extra buttons, this is a very minor issue.

5 Star Requirements
- Price point must be reasonable (I'd expect a $500 keyboard to be great)
- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues
- Must be easy to use (e.g., I don't have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)
- Must perform as advertised (none of this ""your experience may vary"" crap)
- Must have a bonus feature I find valuable (e.g. the mute button on this keyboard)",Great keyboard!,1358899200,

If you spend a lot of time typing, this may be just what you need. However... there is one major flaw: the space bar. It often sticks or is slow to come back up & it makes a clacking sound each time you press it. I considering sending it back, but after doing an online search discovered this keyboard problem has existed for years. There are numerous pages with ""fixes"" for the problem.
While I will not recommend my solution (because it seems absurd to be fixing a new keyboard), here is what I did to fix my space bar:
  I love to kayak fish, so of course I always have some 303 Protectant on hand. I discovered years ago that cleaning my PC trackballs with 303 made 'em very slick, so I figured whatever was sticking on the keyboard could be ""303ed"".
The space bar came right off using a small bent screwdriver. I was careful not to bend the small steel tension bar underneath & pried the space bar up side to side so it didn't come off at an angle. I found that the ""clacking"" is caused by the bottom of the space bar hitting against a plastic surface, so this was an easy fix with a piece of sticky-back Velcro. I used a cotton swab to apply 303 to the plastic posts & inserts (1 center, 2 smaller each side of space bar) & also put some at the little tension bar pivot points for good measure. It's been several weeks now & the space bar hasn't stuck once & I sure don't miss that clacking either.

Enter the 4000.  Big improvement on the already good.
For me, the split keyboard helps me hit the right key - my fingers stay out of each others way.  Key size and margin also contribute to typing accuracy - critical for me with a reconstructed hand.
As to that 'hard' <space> key:  Yeah, so?  I like a key that fights back, lets you know when it's been punched.
All the keys are lively - if you want the 'typing on a sponge' feeling, keep looking.
The customization keys are handy as are the added keys above the number pad.
The Zoom and scroll functions are handy - very handy in my case.
No wider than most, the front-to-back depth is almost 10"" - so you need some room but the wrist rest is welcome.
Overall the board has a quality feel - durable, with the possible exception of the pop-up feet to adjust the height of the back of the board - had a problem with these on the 2000 (they snapped off) but it is not a mission-failure flaw as it's fixable.
Comes with no instruction, but self installs - at least under Win 7 64-bit (my machine).
Overall, the best keyboard I've had.  The 'bump' in the middle also helps relieve strain.

At first it was a little hard training my hands and fingers on this split keyboard. Once I learned where all the keys were I was able to touch type, which is a huge time saver for me since I had always been a hunt and peck. Now I can type without looking and I can type for longer periods of time without having my shoulders, arms, or hands hurting. I also have been able to increase the words per minute.

I wouldn't want to use any other type of keyboard.

Pro: The cost was a huge plus for me. I purchased it while it was on sale so I purchased 2 of them for less than $30 each.
The keyboard is very well built. It has taken several emotional outbursts, where I have hit the keyboard with my fists without breaking anything. The favorite Keys are great. I program them for all my tools that i use on a daily bases. In addition the shortcut pre-programmed keys for Internet Explorer, Email, Calculator, as well as the multimedia controls which I use to control my iTunes while I work.

Con: The layout of the function keys always seems to cause problems for me. When I reach for the F5 key I seem to always miss and hit the Favorites 1, 2 or the Favorites star key. Since I don't use the F5 much it isn't a big deal but can cause some frustration because it breaks the flow of work. The only other Con is the retail cost. I have found that it is an item that is on sale a few times a year.

I like the fact that this is a wired/USB keyboard.

The keyboard has a nice shape to it... if you're looking for an ergonomic keyboard! If you don't like the split keys - obviously don't buy this. I've noticed some people complaining a little bit about sticking keys. I did not experience that issue on the two that I bought. (luck?)

The key strokes are very soft/silent. My hands rest naturally on the keyboard. I like the little function buttons above like calculator. There's a zoom toggle between the two keyboard halves.

I've always wanted to try the ergonomic style keyboards, and the price was right with this model hence my first try at this keyboard style. I won't lie, it takes some time getting acclimated to the key layout and the fact that Microsoft also split the number and F-keys doesn't make it easier. Luckily the cursor keys and number pad stay familiar. It took me about 2-3 days to get used to the split layout, and it does help you type ""correctly"" as I have grown sloppy over the years with using the wrong finger for the keys. It is a bad habit I developed from years of first-person shooter gaming where I'd use a mouse and keyboard together.

The shortcut keys are a big help, and once Windows 7 detected my new keyboard, it automatically installed Microsoft Intellipoint Type which produces an on-screen display for the volume adjustments. This OSD pops up whenever you use the volume adjustment shortcut keys on the keyboard. The Web/Home and Search keys work properly, but the Mail shortcut key directed me to Outlook by default even though my default mail program was Mozilla Thunderbird. I had to manually reset the shortcut key to Thunderbird via the Intellipoint software.

The integrated zoom feature is awesome but only works if you have the Intellipoint software installed. I use the keyboard at work where the drivers are not permitted, but when I evaluated the zoom feature at home it worked like a charm. The back and forward keys work fine without the driver, as does the calculator shortcut key. The coolest feature of this keyboard is the soft integrated palmrest. It feels like a thin foam padded wrest but it has a nice synthetic cover. It is extremely comfortable to use.

Overall: 5/5 stars, some time is required to acclimate to the split layout, and I still find myself mistyping words after over a week of use. My typing speeds have slowed down somewhat, but I am confident it will pick up with additional practice. Awesome integrated palmrest, useful and handy shortcut keys.","Comfortable to use, but the split layout takes time for familiarization",1355702400,

At first, this keyboard was fantastic and it immediately relieved my wrist pain. However, two years later, I have actually gone back to my old Apple Wireless Keyboard because the ergonomic one feels decidedly 'spongy.' In other words, typing doesn't feel crisp, but rather mushy and requires a lot of force to type. It becomes quite fatiguing when writing long essays, or if you have to type for a living, like a software engineer or aspiring writer. You may like it at first, to relieve your pain, but may find yourself going back to 'crisper' keyboards to combat typing fatigue.

Sidenote: I've also disassembled and air-pressure canned my keyboard clean, and it still feels mushy. I'm not sure if it was mushy when I first got it, but it is definitely mushy two years after getting it.

Big hands?  Wrist injury or arthritis?  This keyboard is perfect.

When I discovered a few years ago how much easier it is to type on an ergonomic keyboard, I set out to find the best one for me.  This one was it.  I tried Logitch, Fellowes, and a few others I can't remember.  Some split, some wave.  When I sat down and started typing with this keybaord for the first time, I knew I had found the Mercedes of keyboards.

There are a few ""problems"" which keep it from getting 5 stars from me.

1. The space bars do tend to need an extra kick from time to time to get them to depress.
2. No backlight.
3. No macro buttons for gaming.

The spacebar issue can be overcome through use.  Once you've used the keyboard enough it will loosen up, and you will also program yourself to subconsciously give it a little more encouragement when you hit it.

The lack of a backlight is becoming a killer for me.  As my eyes get older I find it more difficult to see the letters on the keyboard.  I am not a touch typist, though I can type around 80 error-free wpm while keeping the keys in my peripheral vision.  Backlighting would help me to keep track of the keys.

Macro buttons...I play games on my computer as well, and macro buttons (like on the Microsoft Sidewinder series) would be welcomed.

If you are looking for an exellent general use keyboard, and have any of the issues I noted above, you should get this keyboard.  It takes a week or so to really get the hang of the split keyboard, but once you get it, you will find it near impossible to type on a regular keyboard.

I have two of these...one for home and one for work.

To be completely honest, I just bought the MS Sidewinder X4 to replace the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at home.  I do less typing there now than when I was in grad school, and much less than at work (where my job is writing things all day).  The Sidewinder X4 solves all three issues I have with this keyboard...it does however introduce new issues...like wrist allignment and such, but for gaming I just reposition the keyboard as needed.

At work?  No question...it's Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and only Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that will work for me.

I am very used to these keyboards, and wouldn't need anything else.  My main complaint is that the key touch changes dramatically with usage.

As a result I have about 5 of them in my garage :(

If the keyboard lasted longer with the original touch feel, I would not need to replace it so soon.  But that perhaps would not be generating as much revenue for Microsoft. Not sure if this quality issue is deliberate or just an outcome of cheaper manufacturing, but it is quite unfortunate.

I am one of those people that do not enjoy typing on a laptop keyboard since it's too small.  I want that nice key stoke feedback from a full size keyboard and always liked the Microsoft Keyboard product offerrings.  When I came upon this one I was thinking how in the world am I going to type in this weird ergonomic position.  A couple of days later, I realized how could I have not been typing this way for so long.  Initially it does need some getting used too, but someone must have done the reasearch, since once you get started you will not want to go back to a normal position keyboard.  I also hope I am preventing further long term issues for my fingers, hands and wrists by typing in this ergo position, but for now I continue to like the feeback of the key strokes and at least mentally I believe I am typing even quicker and with more accuracy (I thank my lucky stars that I took Senior Year High School Typing Class!).

The existence of a wrist pad is always good, but there is a plastic platform that can be installed underneath the keyboad to raise it off the surface which then angles your typing downwards in a supposed better ergo position.  I did notice there is no SLEEP button like from my previous keyboard, but you soon forget about this and just either use your mouse or close your laptop cover.

In addition I have to say that I like the additional email function keys to further reduce your time using the mouse.  Especially that ""SEND"" button.

As with the Elite, the Natural 4000 has a good split layout on which my fingers fit naturally and comfortably, reducing the strain for long-term typing that I can otherwise feel in the back of my hands. Some of the additional functions not present on the Elite, such as volume control, are appreciated.

I do, though, miss the clickier feel of the Elite; the Natural 4000 has a softer, quieter key feel that is probably better in crowded offices but gives a bit less tactile feedback. I also do not like the software that comes with the Natural 4000; there's no easy way to reconfigure certain keys (e.g. turning the less-than-useful zoom switch into a scroll switch), and the brightness ""feature"" accessed by typing control-left arrow and control-right arrow can interfere with using those key combinations for text navigation.

The 4000 went back to the store the the next day and I replaced it with a Natural Keyboard Elite.

The problem, that would be the space bar.  I really liked everything else about the product, but could not get around the space bar. It does NOT engage when pressed, usually on either of the outer areas at the corners.  I am a touch typist and this space bar significantly dropped by speed and increase my error rate.  I tried to train myself to press more to the center of the space bar which worked just fine, but time and time again I would find myself pressing one or the other of the ""little wings"" with the result of no action and no space produced.

I have used the natural keyboard for 18 years and would choose nothing else.  But this keyboard is just very poorly designed for a touch typist.  A newcomer or hunt and pecker would probably not have this trouble with the space bar.

I would have given it only one star but liked the other functionality of the keys and especially the raised lip on the bottom of the wrist side of the keyboard.  I have been using a negative angle on my keyboards for many years and just find that is the less stressful way to type.  (negative angle is when the edge of the keyboard where the space bar is,is higher than the further edge of the keyboard, where the function keys are).  This position allows the fingers, wrists and forearms all to be in a natural straight line, there by decreasing at least one of the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.","Wonderful, comfortable, BUT....",1336953600,

That and people complained about the cramped numberpad which I use a lot.

It may not be stylish as a logitech, or as solid as a 80's mechanical keyboard but this thing still beats them all at comfort and reliablity.

Actual Review:

The keys are pretty silent but I type kind of fast and hard so there is some muted clacking but it's pretty light.  The keys themselves have a matted feel to them and spring back up when you press down.  You don't need a lot of force to press but you know you pressed a key.  Rarely can you accidently press a key and not know you did (never happened to me but I guess these things can happen).

There are reviews about the how you have to press near the center of the spacebar to register a ""space"" but I've never had that.  The spacebar is oversized and my thumbs rest directly on it without any effort on my part.  Some split keys boards have the two spacebars or the oddly shaped one but this board has an oversized one that spands the entire split.

I've never set up the ""My Favorites"" keys so I can't comment on those but I saw somewhere online that you could substitute macros rather than *.exe or homepages.  (If I find it again I'll edit this post.)

The Zoom button I use rarely but only when I need to up the font size in Notepad++.

I use the hell out of the volume and calculator buttons.  The play button works in iTunes but is really meant for Windows Media Player.  The volume controls are meant for the system sound not as a media player control.

My programming enviroments do not recognize the ""=""/""(""/"")"" keys found above the numberpad but this is due mainly to such old software (VS6) but Word (even 2010) sees them.

Cons:

The only real complaint I have is that there is no real wireless version.  The 7000 I think is wireless but you need to use the mouse and I have no need for it (I use a Logitech VX at home and a MX at work).

And just a note, depending on what OS and hardware you are on the volume controls can take up to a 3-4 seconds to adjust the volume.  I'm pretty sure on a fast system that you won't even notice a lag if there is one.

Remarks:

After 5 years of solid use the key that were oringally matte are now shiny and a few letters have rubbed off but the keyboard still works just as it did the day I first set it up.  It's been to 3 different companies and survived 2 moves.  The pleather/leather is still the same color as it was, no rips, no fading, no tearing apart, no little pieces flaking off, etc.  A rubber foot did come off but that happened like a few months ago which agains speaks volumes about the overall construction.  And the little led lights on the bottom still work!

I have always been perturbed by how the keyboard is split incorrectly. That is, against the normal teaching method of using the right hand to access the number 6. I also can't stand to spread my hands sideways like I'm massaging a beach ball.

Aside from that they have been a huge pain in the neck. The failure rate for these keyboards is very high compared to our standard HP and Lenovo keyboards. They just are not durable. We've had many fail because the cord gets an open or short circuit. We've had even more get the dreaded stuck key issue. Even though the key doesn't appear to be physically stuck, but the key will repeat itself ad infinitum. It has been the space bar mostly, but other keys also suffer the same problem. Unfortunately these have been a thorn in the side because of their reliability problems. If reliability is important to you there are better choices like a true mechanical keyboard (pricey), or even just a name brand business keyboard.

EDIT: I just had another one fail. That is 4 in one week. Fortunately Microsoft replaces them free of charge (90 day warranty from date of initial call); you just have to wait on hold for 35 minutes so they can troubleshoot. Next time I will wait a while to call so I can group them all together and only call once.

EDIT 6/2012: Two more just failed. This time Microsoft wants the old ones sent back. Last time I was told that I just needed to keep the old ones for warranty purposes. ??
EDIT 6/2012: One more failed. Microsoft must have changed manufacturers recently, since these keyboards have normally held up much better than this.

It turned out for me that it was needed, in addition to the rubber mat on this board doing little for my comfort the back and forward keys located under the space bar are too easy for me to hit when typing on this.  With the wrist rest I now have clearance over them though can no longer see the LED's for Num/Scroll/Caps LOCK.

I think it was noted in another review the keys are not painted on but stickers, my fear was they'd be cheap stickers and come off, well I was wrong about that.  They are however still cheap in that they wear off from use, perhaps not cutting my fingernails super short?, I've got 2 keys that lost almost half their white lettering after 4 months and a third just starting. My previous keyboards went years before letters started to fade/wear off but not this one.

I'll add I'm not a fan of the limited choices in ergo boards, the small enter key, the cross style of arrows or reduced backspace key.  This was the best fit for the layout I wanted that I could find and wasn't priced ridiculously, I don't think I even found an outrageously priced one that was my 'perfect' layout.

Finally I'll state the obvious it is black and hard to see if you have low or poor lighting, with my monitors I'm often somewhat 'blinded' to see keys instantly.  Just something to remember when choosing this, white letters are nice but in a field of black they don't stand out that much against a couple of 23"" screens, even worse if the letters start to fade.

I switched to using an ergo keyboard 10 years ago (due to wrist pain from using standard keyboards) and I won't go back.  It took about 3 days to get used to it. Not only is it painless for me to type on an ergo keyboard, I actually type faster.

So what is preventing me from giving this product five stars?  It lacks USB ports.  My previous ergo Microsoft keyboard had two USB ports, which made it easy to plug in the mouse!!  Without those ports, I have two wires heading to the computer tower instead of one.

If you've been on a flat keyboard all day, roll your wrists out about 45 degrees and see what a relief that is.

If you are on the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard right now, twist your wrists up into the position a flat keyboard requires and you'll probably think to yourself, ""My god, how did I ever make it through a whole day like that?""  (I just tried it, and that was exactly what I thought.)

Flat keyboards are bad for you.  If you are having wrist problems from typing, you should probably get one of these.

I just wish they'd start making keyboards dishwasher safe.

I have been using this keyboard for over 8 years now and I continue to be happy with the results.  I am a programmer and type all day long.  My wrists started hurting years ago and surgery became a consideration.  By switching to this keyboard and using a mouse pad with a wrist support I have been able to avoid surgery and do my work without pain.  The result is an improvement in my life due to changing to this ergonomic keyboard.

The tilt and angles, including the split takes a bit of time to adapt to, but once done it's very easy to use and does feel natural.  There's a raised front edge piece but due to the height I like to keep my desk at I take that off and use the keyboard in a more level posture.  On Win7 and the newer you don't need any special software, in fact it no longer comes with any, support is built into the OS now.  While there a programmable keys for misc features, I don't use any of that and actually would prefer that they were removed and that the keyboard was smaller.

I get a few years out of each keyboard and do my best to keep them clean and dry, water doesn't do nice things for anything plugged into power ;-)  After enough time the keys get a polished look and then the printed text on the keys starts to wear off, but I'm a touch typer anyways so that hasn't been an issue, enough of the letters are there to still assure my hands are in the right place.  What rubs off and where on each key depends on your personal hand placements.

I pair my keyboard up with the Belkin Waverest Gel Mouse Pad and am happy with the results and looks on my desk.

I really liked that keyboard.
For whatever reason, I moved away from the ergonomics and have had standard keyboards for a while now. My Dell keyboard recently gave up the ghost so I decided to go back to a Microsoft ergonomic and settled on this one.
There are nice touches, such as the scroll knob in the middle of the keyboard and the padded palm rest.
But the keyboard itself has a cheap feel to it (much cheaper than the Dell keyboard I was using) and the keys are a bit mushy...
But the space bar is *horrible*.
When you press the space bar with your right thumb it feels awful, it makes a loud click, and sometimes it just doesn't work.

A) I like the feel of the ergonomic layout.
B) It's a little bit of a hassle to return to Amazon just because I have to head out to the UPS store.
C) The price was low enough to take a chance.

The biggest drawback is the space bar. Maybe it needs a breaking in period but I have a feeling it'll just get worse.

01/12/12 - Just a quick update to my original review. I googled for ""microsoft 4000 keyboard space bar"" and there are a LOT of reports of this issue out there. Not sure why Microsoft hasn't fixed it yet. At any rate, here's what worked for me.
If you pop off the space bar there are a couple of tiny triangular tabs - one underneath the 'N' key and one underneath the 'B' key. The one under the 'N' key was broken and hanging on. As many commenters in my search recommended, I removed it and cut off the one under the B key as well. This has helped the space bar a lot, though it's not perfect. It's definitely much better now.

10/16/12 - A couple of months ago I gave up on this keyboard entirely. The noise that the space bar makes was driving me nuts.

But ergonomic keyboards opened a whole new world for me. Thanks to Microsoft's efforts in this field, I have been using these ergo-boards from MS since they were first introduced. And while I had grown found of the wireless variety, I realized that I rarely ventured far from the computer with the keyboard, and craved the immediacy of operation that a USB keyboard offers, plus the price was about half of that of a wireless. I bought mine from Amazon on May 28th, and by September, the ""O"" key had stopped working. I called warranty support and was stunned when they told me they would gladly replace my keyboard--just as soon as I returned my defective unit at my own expense. What happened to the Microsoft that overnighted a replacement unit without even asking for the defective item in return. This was usually the case, though I have no problem returning defectives as long as I am reimbursed. So, now I have to make the choice to just whether to buy a ""Like New"" used keyboard for a little bit more than it will cost to ship this one, or just play Microsoft's game and send this back for a new one. Amazonians should note that this kind of behavior on the part of a company like Microsoft (and Logitech is moving in the same direction) serves to provide incentive to internet shoppers like myself to venture out into the real world. Had I purchased the item at a big box store, I could take it back without having to pay for return shipping, and that's that. But for Microsoft to add to the cost of a unit that is already defective and has cost me time and money in the process shows me just how much they care about the consumer. Zero. Because, after all, I could be running some kind of huge keyboard scam and making millions. Seriously, I can't give this keyboard a high rating when a key goes bad so soon. I have had that problem with the wireless version, but only after a few years usually. And MS ALWAYS sent me a new keyboard without question and without asking for the defective one to be returned. That kind of customer service won them my oyalty for years. It's amazing how quickly, however, that loyalty can be destroyed by shoddy, selfish, and utterly lacking customer support. This will be my last Microsoft keyboard. Fortunately I already own about a dozen that should hold me until they fall apart, one by one. Good customer service pays for itself.

I found I could only type fast (ie. touch type) the letters until I tried using a META/SHIFT key, number key or any other key aside from the usual unshifted alphabet letters.  I attributed this to the unusual wave design of the key layout which is supposed to promote stress free typing, which is does -- but while promoting a bad style of typing preventing the keyboard user from typing all other keys!  Hence, you're likely to use this keyboard for online irc chat rooms and quick chatting where you don't use anything but lower case letters!

I've recently purchased a Unicomp ""Customizer 104/105 (P/N UB4044A)"" mechanical (spring) keyboard along with a Leopold FC3456-A (brown switch) mechanical keyboard.  Although the Leopold brown switch keyboard I can type extremely fast, it's size and key layout is smaller causing numerous mistypes.  The Unicomp keyboard, I can type much better, but not as fast as the Leopold due to the stiffer springs while mistypes are much fewer.  I can also find finger/hand placement much easier and faster on the Unicomp board.  The Unicomp keyboard has a raised stepping for it's keys, providing more spacing for those of us with muscles in our hands.  Only gamers are going to like the smaller keybaords, as they can place the keyboard in their laps unlike those of use that work and need a desk for typing.

In brief, it took me weeks to relearn how to properly type so I could type numbers and other characters using META and Shift keys!  I don't think I'll ever buy another ergonomically styled key layout keyboard again!  I find it strange since we invented typewriters, the QWERTY keyboard has survived this long while the typewriter manufacturers never created an ""ergonomically styled typewriter""???  But all of a sudden the IBM style keyboards almost disappeared and replaced with these plastic switch keyboards.  (Sorry for the lack of clarity within the last couple of sentences, but the thought is there, it's just not described very well. :-/)

Anyways, I'm more privy to use the Unicomp keyboard when using VIM and will save the Leopold for typing very long reports.

As for these Microsoft keyboards, they really good for the price, but beware you'll take several weeks to learn how to type on them and then once you grow tired of them after a year, you'll need to relearn how to type for several weeks on another style of keyboard.  My advice, stick with the IBM Model M layout.  They've been around for a long time, likely for a reason!

2013.01.08: If you type a lot, then try buying a keyboard with softer keys, allowing easy touch-typing.  A good option I'm liking, except for the smallness or the ""less then actual size keyboard or typewriters"", are the Leopold keyboards (ie. Model FC3456-A). Keys seem closer together then the above Unicomp IBM Model M keyboard, and my fingers are far from being fat! These smaller keyboards seem to be great for little kid hands/fingers.

While my keyboards work decently, I was overcome with problems; the mechanical M1 keyboard was a poor keyboard for typing (the feeling was off and I was making an abnormal amount of typos) and my basic Logitech keyboard, a membrane kind, started off nicely but turned rather crappy as time went on.  It was time for a new keyboard.

I was in a pinch between going after a new mechanical keyboard or an ergonomic one (you can have both, but the cost is prohibitive).  After some thought, I went with a cheaper route and for this keyboard.  Upon opening it, it looked great; sure, it wasn't PS/2 compatible, but the wrist support was superb. Build quality was great throughout, although it's no mechanical keyboard.  It was wonderful to put my hands on the wristpad (which was lightly padded and covered with faux leather--it's really better than it sounds), ready to type.

Then I began typing.

Problems began to surface.  The keys were too stiff; I don't remember any keyboards that required break-in periods. They are usually shipped new and that's the best condition for the keyboards; it goes downhill as they age.  The keyboard layout, I could nitpick about, but seeing as it's an ergonomic keyboard, there's no reason to (it's probably better to adapt than to whine about it).  The dealbreaker, though, is the spacebar.

It's an ill-conceived, ill-designed, ill-manufactured piece of junk.  Not only is the force required to type with it high, it often refuses to be pressed. Sometimes it gets stuck. Overall, whatever good thing I had to say about the keyboard, the godforsaken spacebar tosses it out the window.

However, if you buy this keyboard, BEWARE THE 'FUNCTION LOCK' BUTTON, which might quite possibly be the dumbest idea ever. Let me explain with an example:

You're using Excel, but unbeknownst to you the 'function lock' key is enabled, which is similar to locking down the shift key. However, unlike caps lock (which locks down the shift key as well), you can't tell the 'shift' key is actually locked down because the letters you type appear as lower case. However, when you go to edit a cell and press F2, your most recent edit disappears. WHY? Because the function lock key treats a press of F2 like you pressed both SHIFT+F2.

>> Shift+F2 is the 'undo' button...and you have no idea what's happening if you accidentally pressed the 'function lock' key as I did.

Annoying? Absolutely. So annoying that I damn near broke this thing in frustration trying to figure out what the hell was wrong.

Suffice to say my keyboards get a LOT of use, at speeds above 100 wpm, utilizing all the symbols and special keys.

I've been just using whatever keyboard I could find or was given, but just decided I need to get a good keyboard. I've had a couple minor wrist problems but nothing chronic, so I just felt like I needed an actually decent keyboard since it is something I use 100% of the time I'm at my computer.

I did my research and ended up choosing this one at the advice of other programmer reviews of it (e.g. Coding Horror). Everything about it is standard, which is absolutely critical to me: the backspace key is double-wide, the modifier keys are in the standard Ctrl-Win-Alt order, escape key is inline with function keys, insert/delete/home/end are normal size and layout. The extra buttons on the keyboard are nice, though I seldom use them and wouldn't miss them if this was just a standard keyboard.

The ergonomics of the keyboard are nice. I like the prop thing that comes with it and haven't removed it. The wrist rests are very soft and comfortable. The split layout doesn't take any time to get accustomed with; I just type like I normally do and my fingers are still hitting the right keys despite my hands being spread apart.

I don't prefer the feel of the keys; they have more of a mushy feel to them than I'm used to. But it's perfectly tolerable, given all the rest of the features of this keyboard, and I understand that every keyboard has a different feel. It's not difficult to type on, just different from what I'm used to.

The build quality is acceptable; the soft wrist pad feels very good quality, but the rest of the keyboard seems pretty mediocre. I suppose this is how they managed to get so much keyboard in so little price - I'm not saying it's not durable, it just doesn't feel expensive. No fancy aluminum here.

It's totally cross platform! I've already used it on both Windows 7 and OS X Lion, and in both cases I had a very good experience. I downloaded and installed the software from Microsoft's website, ignoring the included CD, before plugging in the keyboard. In Windows, the keyboard works exactly as expected - and as it should, given it's a Microsoft keyboard. In Mac, it was recognized immediately and the keys default to the mapping familiar with Mac users; so where Mac keyboards have the order Control-Option-Command, this keyboard too takes on that order (""Ctrl"" = control, ""windows"" = alt/option, ""alt"" = command). The special keys also work as expected by default, and are totally configurable in a prefpane in System Preferences. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Mac driver.

Overall, I love the keyboard and will be recommending it to anyone who is in the market for a keyboard! It even looks to be perfectly good for gaming - I'll need to test that. :)",Best keyboard I could find!,1313625600,

For about a month, I used this as my primary keyboard.  Then, I happily unplugged it and am hoping now to find it a new home.

I could handle the sheer bulk of it, though I didn't care for it.  I even got used to the fact that I often mistyped things (I use a sort of modified touch typing method where the finger closest to the key in question hits it rather than the ""right"" finger) because of the curved layout.

What I couldn't get used to was the feeling that I needed to reach down into the keyboard (because of the length wrist rest) and pound the keys to get them to register.  The space bar was especially problematic. I couldn't just ""tap it"".  I had to whack it pretty hard, and even then it often didn't register. I ended up going from a touch typist who didn't have to look at the keyboard often to someone who had to keep staring at the keyboard to figure out where the heck some of the keys were or why I kept getting a B when I wanted an N.

It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked.

It's at least 3 inches wider (and a lot bulkier) than my old standard Dell keyboard, not counting the wrist pad or elevating stand. That's a good thing, as it's solid and stays in place, but it also takes up a lot of space. Just from the way it's designed, this isn't the kind of keyboard you can just quickly tap single letters on; you have to put both hands in the correct position or it just feels weird.

The keys feel nice and are pretty quiet. You do have to move your fingers quite far for some letters though (y and b are too far from j and f), and the space bar feels a bit squishy. I like that you can create your own shortcuts for each of the top function keys, and the zoom and back/forward buttons are nice to have (though the back/forward buttons are too far down and my mouse already has those).

I can see how the key labels can wear off; they're decals, not etched on. The wrist pad feels nice but picks up debris really easily. Also, my stand is lopsided when I have the legs extended. I put a mousepad under one of the legs to compensate, but it still makes a creaking sound at times.

All in all, it's a nice keyboard for the money (especially given the limited...or nonexistent...selection at retail stores), if you can get past its issues and take the time to get used to it. I haven't noticed an improvement in my typing speed yet, but with practice...

EDIT: 2 months later, I've noticed some wear on the wrist wrests. I still haven't gotten used to the keyboard for typing, but then I don't exactly type up big documents on a daily basis either.","Ergonomically nice, but quirky and has a learning curve.",1301011200,

And one non-functioning one on the shelf that was the victim of a water spill (unfortunately, no keyboard seems to be immune from liquid damage). I'll keep using one of these as long as they are around for me to use.

The layout is great. It takes an hour or so to get used to it, but once you do, you'll find your typing speed and accuracy both increase.

It's as easy as any keyboard to install, and I haven't had any problem with it working outside of the one I ruined by spilling water on it. Keys responds well, they don't need you to hammer on them, in fact you can type pretty gingerly on it.

The ""candy"" on the keyboard isn't very functional to me, beyond the back-forward buttons near the space bar...I actually set those to skip through my music playlist. Love that feature! The zoom toggle in the middle...I reprogrammed that to be a scroll. I still don't use it all that often. I use the music controls at the top, and the calculator...but I don't really care about the shortcut keys.

I love the layout, though, and finding true ergonomic keyboards is becoming harder to do, what with Logitec bailing out completely, along with many other vendors.

So I make do with my Brother P-Touch label maker's little tags replacing the worn paint.  But these only last a week or so, before needing replacement.

I suppose I could purchase from a local vendor, then return it within their trial period for a replacement, and keep this up until Microsoft starts paying attention to quality control...

1. Keys fade quickly. In about 2 or 3 months tops, the imprint on the most frequently used keys will disappear completely. This is normally a non-issue for experienced typists, but since I work with Unix consoles most of the time, remembering where the pipe or the backlash is was infuriating. Not to mention the fact that it should not happen on a ""premium"" product.

2. Space bar gets stuck. This happened mostly when the keyboard was new. After about a month or so the key loosened a bit and rarely got stuck again, but probably my fingers started remembering where to press on it to avoid that too. Sometimes it still got stiff as if the spring went bad.

3. Two drops of liquid were enough to kill it. Obviously you should not get a keyboard near any liquids, but everybody do it all the time and usually they can handle a bit of moisture. Well, not this one. I took it apart to see why it stopped working and I was surprised to see that the plastic ""floor"" under the keys is not a single piece, but actually has lots of cracks and holes by design, and they give direct access to the electronics to anything you may throw in there by accident.

I started using this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web hosting company, and... wow. It really made a huge difference in my comfort level sitting at the desk. I had begun to develop a bit of carpel tunnel, tingling in my wrist and fingers, etc; after buying this keyboard, it all went away. I'm not suggesting that will be everyone's experience, just that it is my own.

I almost never use the short-cut keys at the top; just never got in the habit. They work, though, for the record.

Let's face it there is nothing sexy or even new about keyboard design, expect for the rise of backlit units.  But the keyboard is one of the most essential parts of the computer; after all, without one the computer is close to useless.

I loved, loved, loved the feel and sound of the old IBM keyboards, but those old white units are hard to come by these days.  The white and black squares clicked and related a fair amount of feedback through the keys.  They keyboard on my HP Pavilion dv9000 approximates the feel and of the old IBM's but not the sound, but I like the keyboard nonetheless.

The keyboard that ship with most dell desktop computers, like to one I use at work, are nice units, but they are almost too small for prolonged typing.  There is nowhere to rest the wrists while typing and that promotes fatigue with prolonged use, at least for me.  And over time, my left wrist will start to hurt.

So the search has been on for quite some time for the perfect ergonomic keyboard; one that feels good underneath the fingers (provides feedback), provides adequate space for the wrists, while also preventing the dreaded wrist ailment c-tunnel syndrome.

I've tried quite a few keyboards over the years so it was time to give Microsoft a try.  The ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" almost delivers.

The 411

Microsoft says of the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 ""has been expertly crafted to allow you to work in a more natural position. The new Gull Wing design features a 14-degree gable, a natural arc and a curved key bed - bringing the keys closer to your fingers to reduce reach and unnecessary motion, while encouraging a more natural typing position. It also comes equipped with an optional palm lift for a seven-degree reverse slope and a cushioned wrist rest that encourages better arm and wrist alignment.""

There are a myriad of silver special function keys throughout they keyboard face including a Zoom Slider that allows for the magnification of digital pictures, maps, etc.  There are also forward and back buttons designed for use with the Internet, as well as (5) customizable My Favorites Hot Keys that can be programmed to ""instantly open the programs, files, and Web pages you use the most.""

Situated on the upper left hand side of the keyboard are three shortcut keys (Web/Home, Search, and Mail), while next to the My Favorites Hot Keys you'll find the typical multi-media controls.  Like most modern keyboards the function keys pull double duty depending on whether or not the F-Lock key is activated.

With the F-Lock on, they perform their standard functions, however with the F-Lock off, the black keys execute a number of useful shortcuts, including save, print, undo/redo, and reply/forward/send for e-mail programs. An added bonus: the function keys are all labeled with their secondary functions.

Installation

I installed the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" on a Dell DX4300 running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  The USB keyboard was recognized right away and all of the function keys worked without installing the included software.

First Impressions

The first thing I noticed--and I am sure any user would--about the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" ($24.95 at Amazon.com) is that it's big!  But that is not necessarily a bad thing because the matt black keyboard had amble room for the wrists to rest while typing.  And the wrist rest are not made of hard plastic like most keyboards in this class; indeed the rests are cover in rubber giving the wrist a cushioned and comfortable place to rest.

I immediately removed the palm lift; talk about awkward! The palm lift made typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" a very difficult prospect.  Luckily it is easily removed.

It is quite evident that Microsoft did not take a page from IBM's keyboard design book when placing they keys on this keyboard; they are hard to push for the most part and give little to no feedback.  Needless to say I do not care for them.  And because of the ""gull-wing"" design of the keyboard typing on the unit can take some getting used to.  After a few hours of typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" I got used to the unique placement of the keys and I am happy to report that production is up!

Conclusion

Though the Microsoft ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" is certainly bigger than some of it contemporaries, that added space is well used.  I like the padded wrist rest, as well as the innumerable special function/programmable keys included in the design.

I do not, however, like the feel of the keys, and the gullwing design took some getting used to.  Overall, I would state the Microsoft has designed a good, solid, useful, ergonomic keyboard with a lot to recommend it in the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.",The (Almost) Perfect Ergonomic Keyboard From Microsoft,1293321600,

For one, it's huge and chews up a lot of desk space.  For another, typing on this keyboard is noisy.

On the other hand, it's a reliable keyboard and keeps working even with minor spills and desk-dust on it, plus the key action isn't bad.  I also have to admit that the hand position ergonomics are pretty decent, too, although I did find the tilt somewhat steep and I was clawing at the keys rather than touch-typing.  In addition, I think that except for media center and console-attached keyboards, they do best when wired, not wireless.  I have a Microsoft 6000 wireless on another system, and it is -constantly- dropping keystrokes, even though the receiver is mere inches from the keyboard itself.

Anyway, the 4000 is a good step up from the MS Natural 2000, with added features and (my impression) better durability.","Solid workhorse keyboard, but large and loud",1292284800,

By day I'm a software developer, by night an instructor at a local university.  I am typing for writing code, and typing my lecture notes, tests, slides, and feedback to students.  I basically live at a keyboard.  I have had previous Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, but this one is by far my favorite for a couple of different reasons.  The primary is that I can type pain free for long periods of time.

While I have one of these keyboards on my desktop at home, and one at work, I don't have one hooked up to my laptop, which is usually sitting on the couch.  It is when I'm using my laptop that I notice the benefits of this keyboard.  After typing on the laptop keyboard for 30-45 minutes, my wrists begin to hurt, and it's generally just not comfortable to type anymore.  Using this keyboard, I can type for hours at a time in complete comfort.

As for the setup, I have the riser on the front and the feet dropped in the back.  This is opposite what many (or most) people do with their keyboards.  I find that the setup allow me to properly use the wrist rest and keeps the keys in a neutral position, allowing me to type quickly and comfortably.

When I first got this keyboard, the setup seemed like the best choice, though the first 3-4 days of using it, I just couldn't get comfortable, then suddenly something snapped (figuratively), and it all the sudden felt extremely comfortable, and natural.  For those of you who buy this and are thinking about returning it after a couple days, give it a week or more to actually try it out.

There are a few thing I don't like about this keyboard, but none of them take off anything from my review, because this is a keyboard.  The primary functions work perfectly.  That being said, the list of things I don't like: The zoom button (never use it, no need), the back/forward buttons, the media buttons (web/home, search, mail, and the macro buttons), never get used.  That being said, Play, volume and mute are often used, and I love them.  The calculator button is also a big win in my book.

How do I know this keyboard is a win?  While work provides us with ergonomic keyboards, they are often not very good ones, which is why I originally bought this one.  After a couple of weeks of use, 3 of my coworkers bought their own, now, 2/3 of the department uses them.

A couple final thoughts.  I have been using this keyboard for 4 years now, and haven't had a reason to consider anything else.  The number are still printed on the keys, I've dropped enough food in it to feed a small cat, and it still functions, I've spilled water on it and it still works (and cleaned out most of the food).

A keyboard (along with a mouse) are how we interface with a computer, and if that is comfortable, you won't do it.  This keyboard is comfortable.  While the split layout may be intimidating at first, it is really an ideal approach to typing, and I highly recommend you give this keyboard a spin.  It's worked great for me for 4 years.","The best keyboard I have ever used, period.",1292198400,

In general this is a great keyboard, except for the fact that Microsoft, like most other keyboard manufacturers now, uses cheap decals on the keys instead of indented and painted key  letters and numbers. A fairly large number of these decals (the most used keys, of course) wore off within months, on my first keyboard. I am a touch typist, so this problem isn't as serious for me as it would be for someone who doesn't touch type, by the way.

And the space bar is a little loud, I agree with the other complaints about this problem, but I'm not sure it needs to be split, although the length of the bar does seem perhaps to be contributing to the noise issue.  For sure, the space bar needs to be quieter and somewhat easier to activate.  Otherwise, the ergonomic layout and performance of this keyboard is very good.

The first one I got for my office at work, and the second for my office at home.  One I love and one I hate.  There is clearly a problem with Microsoft's quality control with these keyboards.

First off, I've been a user of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro for years -- they are no longer available, and I bought five of them when the product was discontinued years ago.  I'm down to my last two somewhat clean keyboards.  The main thing I've been looking for in a new ergonomic keyboard is the correct setup for the arrow keys, with left, down, and right in a straight row, and up right above down (follow that?).  The 4000 has that, plus the curved split keyboard that I have really come to love.

The 4000 I have at work, the first one I got, is great.  All the keys have a fairly consistent feel and are quiet.  I preferred the utility button layout of the older Natural Keyboard Pro, and rather wish the function keys had their normal functions on the top (F1, F2, etc.) rather than the ""make it easy"" labels which only work on some programs, but otherwise, it's a perfectly adequate replacement.

The one I got more recently at home has one of the problematic spacebars.  It's LOUD.  If all the keys were this loud, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's very annoying and distracting to be typing and have a very loud slam/click every time I hit a space.  I pulled the spacebar key off a few times and tried to fix it, so far to no avail.  Finally I unplugged the new keyboard and went back to one of my remaining Natural Keyboard Pro copies.

It's hard for me to believe that computer keyboards have been around for more than 40 years and yet they still can't get such a simple thing right.

I have other keyboards: two that came with two HP PCs and a Logitech one purchased separately.  Now that I am used to the MS wide, curved layout I feel cramped using those.  With regular keyboards my arms feel as if plastered to my sides and quite cramped.  The Logitech keyboard is nice because it wireless but it doesn't match up to the MS keyboard in terms of comfort.

I am still giving the MS keyboard 4 (up from 3) stars.  If it retained the ink on its keys and was wireless it would be darn near perfect.

First update -------- I am updating this review since Microsoft replaced the keyboard and I am both surprised (!) and happy that they did.  I tried placing stickers on the keys and then writing on them but that didn't work.  I will take the advice from another reviewer about using nail polish on the keys to keep the letters from disappearing.  I think keyboards should last longer than this but Microsoft did stand behind their product so kudos for that service.

I do not know what is happening to keyboards but so many of them seem fragile and poorly made.  My Dell laptop has keys that literally broke.  The plastic piece that attaches the key to the board broke on two keys.  The keyboards that came with a new HP computer were so awful that I threw them away in favor of the Microsoft one.  I am now trying a Logitech keyboard to see if someone can make a keyboard that works for at least a year.

Original review ------ I can imagine that this is a good keyboard from an ergonomic perspective.  It has a very different feel from the standard flat keyboard and it takes up much more space as well.  It takes a good long while to get used to it but it is comfortable.

The reason I would like to give it negative stars is that the printing on the keys is disappearing with less than 6 months of use.  OK, I know my keyboard layout but this is ridiculous.  Just for comparison's sake, I have a very standard beige keyboard that has keys in almost as bad a condition as this one.  That keyboard is 10 years old.

On the Microsoft keyboard the E and R are almost completely gone and the I, K and S are close behind.  I do not know if this is a function of whatever they are using to put white print on black keys or just cheap junk manufacturing.

As for this keyboard in particular, there are good and bad things, but overall this is one of the best keyboards I've used.

The good:

1) As many have pointed out, the keys have the appropriate amount of spring to them, not too hard to push and very responsive.  And they're also very quiet.

2) The extra buttons can be programmed, even on a Mac, if you download the Intellitype software from Microsoft.  Very handy!

3) Very durable. I've typed a LOT over the last few years and it's still going strong.  All the keys continue to work properly.

The bad:

1) The first one I received had a ""sticky"" space bar, similar to the problem other reviewers have faced.  Initially I removed it and tried to modify it, but I ended up getting a free replacement directly from Microsoft, and it works great.  They didn't ask for the defective one back.

2) Ergonomic keyboards are larger than regular ones, so the footprint on your desk will be larger.  For me, it's worth the added comfort.","Excellent keyboard, works great with Mac",1282608000,

I took about a week to get really comfortable with it.  The number 6 took the longest to get used to since its on the left hand side.  However,once you get used to it, you can really type quickly.

The angle of your wrists are more relaxed and the palm rest makes typing much more comfortable.  My wrist and hand pains have gone away.

Now let me get to my review of this keyboard.

At first I really hated the keyboard. I really didn't like how the keyboard split up, but my wrist was hurting, so I needed an ergonomic keyboard. Out of the box, the space bar was stuck, and was really hard to push down as I type. However, after about a week of usage, it loosen and you're able to type at normal speed without consciously pushing the space bar down harder.

So - just keep it dry?  Sure, but as hard as I try to keep this thing dry, I don't always succeed.  For example, I recently placed a glass of iced tea on my desk well away from the edge that is above the keyboard drawer.  I walked away for a few minutes, and when I came back, the sweat off the side of the glass pooled and the tiny river of water just happened to route itself to drip a few drops off the desk onto the keyboard.

Keep the Plastic Attachment intact by the wrist pad:
I kept the plastic attachment by the pad which makes the keyboard slanted towards the front and elevated by the wrist.  It may look a bit weird at first but once you get used to it works to your benefit.

Customer Service:
Microsoft Customer Service was surprisingly good. One of the keys stopped working for the one I use at work.  I called support and soon they sent me a replacement keyboard.  I didn't have to send the old one back.

Other concerns:
One word of caution, key labeling seems to vanish after continuous use.  Another colleague had similar problem and Microsoft sent him a replacement.

Features:
There are some programmable hot-keys around the top of the key-board. One may find these helpful along with the Zoom key in the middle. I personally only use the zoom key among all of these extra buttons and even at a very minimum.

I owned an early model of the ergonomic key board that did not have all the bells-and-whistles of the 4000 model. I do know how to type, but I am not overly fast when typing. However because of the way the 4000 key board is set up I find that it is the most comfortable key board I have ever used. The key board has a pad to rest my wrists upon when typing. In addition, the front of the key board is elevated while the back of the key board is at a lower elevation than the front. This causes my hands to tilt downward to the key board when typing. This positioning of the key board is far more comfortable than my previous ergonomic key board. The MS 4000 key board comes with hot keys to perform a number of different functions and I have enjoyed using them, but it is the comfort of typing that I have enjoyed the most when using the key board.
 Before I ordered this key board from Amazon.com I thoroughly read all the reviews for this item. I was concern about the complaint that the space key did not work properly. The complaint was that when pressing the space key extra force/pressure was needed to make the key function. I have not had this problem at all. However, I have large hands and my thumbs sit right at the middle of the space key when my wrists are sitting on the key pad to type. I have not had to use any additional pressure on the space key and it functions perfectly for me. I am satisfied with the key board and would purchase another one if needed. I gave this key board a rating of 4 stars and not 5 stars because I have only been using it for almost 3 months. After a year if everything is still working as well, I would change the rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.",Satisfied with the key board,1266364800,

Its nice looking and easy to get accustomed to, just spend a few days typing in it and I can type as fast as I used to with the previous keyboard I had (standard). Great palm rest support allows you easy typing, also it comes with a lot of extra keys, and they are easily customizable using the provided/downloaded software from Microsoft.

Pros

Easy to use.
It has a lot of keys.
It is pretty good looking, it has a great palm rest support and it is also pretty sturdy.
Great Windows 7 support, just plug and play.

Cons.
Space bar makes a lot of sound when pressed. (not too much but i kinda don't like it)
Despite the fact that it comes with multimedia keys, it lacks the buttons for previous and next track, so it's a little annoying, there is a work around to assign them to one of the 5 ""favorites keys"", but you have to do a little Windows registry hack.
Sometimes the extra keys lag a little while when you first pressed them, it disappears right after you press another key or the same one, I think it's a known issue of the Microsoft Intellitype software, I hope they fix it someday.

Bottom line.

I've been using Microsoft Natural keyboards since they came out in the early/mid 90's, back when they cost nearly six times as much money. And, as the price has gone down on the ""regular"" Natural keyboards, so has the quality. With the 4000, I knew it was a step up, and I very much preferred the faux leather wrist rest over the plastic one on the standard Natural keyboard, so I didn't consider any alternatives.

I noticed that the price I got on the 4000 was pretty stellar, and hadn't given it much more thought until the keyboard arrived. Sadly, Microsoft has chosen to make the 4000 flimsier and less responsive than older models. The very first thing I noticed was that the Windows key on the new keyboards has a beveled logo (unlike my old 4000 keyboard, which looks like the one in Amazon's picture). I thought this was to unify their branding with the Vista and Windows 7 logos, but didn't realize that this was now a decent identifier of ""new"" keyboards.

The newer 4000's feel really cheap. Key travel isn't remotely as smooth as in the previous generation, and I'd go as far as to say that it isn't as good as a basic Natural keyboard. The mechanisms don't seem to be built for larger keys, so you have to find sweet spots in keys like CTRL and the space bar, or else you're just bending plastic without registering a keystroke.

On Windows, not surprisingly, plugging in the keyboard is all you need to do. You can install the Intellitype software, but it doesn't do much beyond adding a few icons throughout the OS and extend macro capability. On OS X, IntelliType is required if you want to swap the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys to represent CTRL, Option, and Command keys on a standard Mac keyboard. The included software works fine on Snow Leopard and the default action is to swap the keys for you. Unfortunately, the software requires a reboot, and they haven't quite figured out 64-bit control panel objects in OS X.

If I had it to do over again, I'd probably go to a bricks-and-mortar store and see if I could score myself an older 4000. Similarly, I'd gladly pay more money to have the quality of the old 4000 back. Microsoft ruined a once-wonderful keyboard (again!) to move more units. Unless you like the look of a black split keyboard over a white one, you might as well save a few bucks more and go with the standard white Natural keyboard.",They don't make 'em like they used to.,1264291200,

As a software developer, the keyboard is the single most important component on my PC, and I've tried most of the ""big"" and common ones: Cherry G81 and G83, das Keyboard, Logitech G-15. But the Microsoft 4000 was not only love at first sight, it is still love to this day. It's one of the few remaining ergonomic keyboards, and I think it's the one that really works. The tile angle is just perfect and the integrated palmrest really shines. It's not just an attachment and not made of plastic, but it's permanently attached and has a soft material so that together with a proper office chair with armrests, you can really place your hands ergonomically.

The keys also have a good hub/resistance, so they really give good tactile feedback and are not too noisy. One problem that the 4000 has is the space bar. On some models, it is very stiff or has to be hit almost exactly in the center. To my knowledge, the only fix to that is to permanently replace it or learn to live with it. My 2007 keyboard has that problem, but the one I bought 2 weeks ago (Jan 2010) has a perfectly working space bar, so I do not know if this is still an issue.

I don't care too much about the extra keys on the keyboard, except the volume control which is important for me. Also, the keyboard came with a ""bar"" that lifts it's front up so that the keyboard is tilted down. Not too sure what this is good for, I removed it immediately as it was a rather uncomfortable experience, but YMMV.

Webb,"This keyboard is great in theory, but the first one I got from Amazon had the ""crazy hard to push"" space bar problem.  You literally could not push the space bar down except when pushing right on the center of it.  You could nearly put all your weight on the extreme left or right sides, and nothing would happen!  Seriously!  After typing for 4-6 hours with that (and re-training myself to hit the space bar in the middle), my arms were very sore and I went back to my slightly broken Goldtouch keyboard.  I disagree with other reviewers who say this is a ""feature"" and that you should press the space bar in the middle for ergonomic reasons.  Bullocks!  The less you have to stretch and strain the better for ergonomics.

I returned the first keyboard to Amazon, but I still needed a new keyboard, and the 4000 seemed to be about the only non-wireless, decently ergonomic keyboard out there.  I was at the local office supplies store, and they had the 4000 on display, and its space bar was very easy to push; so I picked one up (albeit for $50).  When I got out to the parking lot I took it out of the box to find that they space bar was indeed much better than the one I got from Amazon, but still has problems on the extreme top left and top right sides of the space bar.

For now I'm sticking with the second 4000 keyboard, it works fine for me.  The space bar is still a little stiff and noisy, but the other keys are awesome.  I think the space bar will break in as well, as the display model had no space bar issues.  My guess is that the one I got from amazon was just a dud, perhaps if I exchanged it the second one would have been acceptable.

As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.

This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.

The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is ""F Lock Key Eliminator"".

The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.

However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.

A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.

For a time after they did away with that design, all they had available was the Natural Keyboard Elite, which totally sucks. The other complaint in their designs was the redesigned placement of the Insert/Home/Pgup/PgDwn area, where the keys were designed in a vertical arrangement. Not to mention the arrow keys were often placed in a cross pattern, instead of the standard old school inverted T. Having worked for Microsoft in the past, I can tell you that sometimes people there over-think things to the point that they think they can reinvent the wheel! I'm sure many of you who work in a corporate environment are familiar with these people. :)

Anyway -

This beautifully designed keyboard appeared on the market a couple of years ago! I've loved most everything about this ting since day one. The keys are the soft, easy, and smooth depression type, the re-designed curvature of the key layout of the major keys is quite an improvement! And feel infinitely better on my hands and fingers. I am also somewhat picky about the looks as well and MS did not disappoint here either. Its sexy black with silver programmable and function keys at the top rock! And they restored the aforementioned insert/home keys to normal placement! Wonderful!

The only improvement they could make IMHO would be to drop the F Lock function all together. This function turns the F1 through F12 keys into Office functions. Anyone who seriously uses their or anyone's office suites, should already know these functions by use of regular hot keys. Though don't fret this all together, at least the F Lock key is off by default, making it less annoying. In short, I view this as a worthless function to their keyboards.

I run a small IT/Consulting (sometimes insulting)/Systems Administration company. I have sold these to clients who prefer the natural design and have heard nothing but rave reviews from them.

For those thinking of making the leap from a standard design keyboard to a natural, I offer this advice... The biggest thing you will have problems with at first is the adjusted reach to keys, because they are positioned differently. If you are serious, give yourself some time getting used to this design. Some do make the trtansition rather quickly, and some folks never do like it. Its well worth the old collage try to see if you can make the leap. :)

Note on price: This Keyboard can be found around $25.00 - 30.00 range. So shop around!

I've heard rumors of the keys being hard to press, which is all together untrue. I have had no issues pressing the keys whatsoever, and I've found them enjoyable. They aren't rough on my hands at all and I really don't see how they could be hard to press. The spacebar, however, does take some time to become accustomed to. Because of the curve of the keyboard it makes the spacebar hard to press because you're not really hitting it in the center and it's not balanced very well. I think this could have been solved with two separate keys for it. Although it is annoying, it is nothing that can't be over seen for the overall superb quality of the product.

I did find the installation of the software annoying. Like anyone else would do, I plugged in the keyboard and booted. Within moments I found that I couldn't type anything, but I had a log in password to type... I had to grab another keyboard and restart. This is really more of my fault, but I think it should have more plug-n-play capabilities. Still, I don't think that's really enough to hate the keyboard.",Good start,1258502400,
379270,3.0,,False,"11 14, 2009",A477SZW855ZPD,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Fletch Hasues,"The Microsoft Natural 4000 excels at being a good standard use keyboard for ergonomics, but under the hood, it fails.  While I am impressed that Microsoft has realized that it was going in the wrong direction from the Microsoft Natural to the Natural Elite, there are other short comings that this and previous keyboards have had, and even more so, most of their periphial line.  If you plan on doing standard typing, development, office work, etc, this is a great keyboard.  However, just as the previous versions of the Natural, if you plan on using many keys simultaneously, this is not your keyboard.

  The Natural 4000 shines in that it is very comfortable as the wrist rest area has built in pads with a soft leatherette feel, the keys are quiet, and we see a return to the front riser which alleviates wrist strain due to it assisting in keeping your wrists straight.  This is important because if a keyboard is going to be truely ergonomic, it needs to focus on what it means to be ergonomic...give a split key design to reduce the outward flair of the wrists and also add a slight angle to accomodate the angle of which the hands must bend to come to the surface of the keyboard.  The Natural 4000, much like its first generation model meets this challenge, which is important if one studies the Natural Elite model which began the decline of following ergonomic design by removing the front reiser and most of the curvature that made this series of keyboards become as popular as it did.  The Natural also gets high marks in that the keys are quiet, they are arranged in the correct standard of 104 or so key layout, so if you are a developer, you know exactly where the keys are going to be (as far as special symbols, namely the ""|"" key, the arrow keys, and the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", etc) are in their correct locations.  This means that any typist can switch to this model and adapt quickly.  So many of the interesting models of ergonomic keyboards re-arrange the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", ""End"", etc keys that it makes the keyboard awkward.  Another common mistake is the keyboard vendors make the arrow keys awkward by moving the left and right arrow keys upward so that they are not aligned with the down arrow key as seen on the common standard.  While this is not a big deal to most people, it is if you plan on using this keyboard for playing games.  This keyboard comes with many media keys that allow you to do such things as start your music player, adjust your volume, start many popular programs including your web browser, etc.

  Stylistically speaking, the keyboard looks very sleek wth its black and gray design, and with curvature that both adds comfort and is asthetically appealing.  With the leatherette in the front, the soft glowing leds, and the extra meta keys, it reminds someone as if he or she has upgraded his or her keyboard to a sports car.  Microsoft gets high marks on the appearance of the device as it does look nice, and the black and gray goes well with the black and silver trends of most periphials and computers.  So, all in all if all this device is going to be used for is the office and development, one may ask what can go wrong.  The answer is, not much.

  However, this is a Microsoft periphial.  Traditionally, the keyboard lines have been okay in the realm of workmanship, however in the mice line, the units simply do not last.  Typically the mice stop responding to events, and simply wear out, which is sad seeing as opticals would seemingly last longer noting the reduction of moving parts.  Unfortunately, this has now crept into the keyboard line as well.  A good example, the Microsoft 2000 keyboard line have been noted for their cheap crafting which results in overall failure for the devices, and people simply discard them.  This has happened in under two years of use.  I'm seeing similar issues in the 4000.  At times, the K key sends an L keystroke as well.  Strange, but okay, just one key.  Then the function keys failed to work.  However there is an F lock key that should be checked, and is normal, but this simply isn't the case as the keys simply do not work.  While many people could argue that they do not use the function keys, in an office environment one most certainly does (how many times do you hit F3 to ""look for the search result again"" after searching for text in a text editor?  how many times do you use F5 for a refresh of a web browser?).  The biggest issue I have is the number of keys one can press at a time before the keyboard simply can't handle any more input.  This is extremely bad if you are a gamer.  First person shooters, one may be able to pull it off, but even the simplest games such as Continuum, or even old titles such as Interstate 76 where multiple keys will be pressed as you are holding one key down for movement, and another one for an action, it is probably headed for failure.  This may be a result of how the Microsoft keyboards handle the control key in their line.  This has been a problem for the Microsoft Natural, Microsoft Natural Elite, and the Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboards, so it is historical.  So if you are even considering a game, I would recommend keeping a cheap usb keyboard in your drawer and using it for gaming.

  The only final notes I can add for the Natural is noting the additional media keys, your mileage of going through a KVM to control multiple computers will vary.  Many KVM vendors will tell you that if you can not control your computer past POST and before boot, it is because the keyboard has too many keys and it is affecting the KVM.  However, I have noted that if keyboards have USB hubs on them, this tends to confuse KVMs in what information is being sent to the computer, so if you are using a KVM, do not plan on using any keyboard with a USB hub as most BIOS's can not handle them for the additional information that is sent that the protocol in the KVM doesn't support.  Also, the Natural 4000 works well with Linux (but again, not well from the Gaming perspective) as there are a few methods that can be used to allow use of the additional media keys.  This is a big plus again for people who want to do development as you can assign various useful events thus removing the need to grab the mouse.

All in all, the 4000 is a decent keyboard, but it is not the be-all end-all solution due to Microsoft not addressing the issues under the hood.  Some may say this coincides with the Microsoft philosophy, but that is for the user to decide.","Ergonomic dream, function disappointment",1258156800,

I was reasonably satisfied with the ergonomics but the key travel seems to be too far and the key resistance is a little to high for constant use. Also the layout of the keyboard is very large. I have average sized hands and I always felt like I had to stretch to reach the number and function keys. Also, occasionally the Function key modifier would get stuck off and the Function keys would no longer work. It was a really stupid feature to overload the function keys with yet another key. Even more stupid is to occasionally lose the user's setting on this key for no reason. So when I hit F6 or F5 to build or debug in Visual Studio, I would occasionally just get crickets ... nothing.

Finally, the thing that took the cake for me was how fragile this keyboard is. I spilled a very small amount of coffee on this keyboard (probably less than a teaspoon) and several keys now fail to function.

379299,4.0,,True,"03 30, 2009",A1RAQTGK72I82Q,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Scott N,"At my previous job, I asked for a natural keyboard since I was starting to have wrist pain (a decade of gaming and computer-based jobs will do that). I ended up going with this one since it had the padded wrist rest and had the option of raising the front end, which I thought would be novel.

After using it for a few days, I wouldn't have traded it for any keyboard in the world (not even the IBM clackers in the supply closet). The keys were responsive, the calculator key worked without installing additional drivers, and (most importantly) my wrist pain had faded away. I was totally hooked and have not purchased a non-ergonomic keyboard since.

I switched jobs last year and had to leave the 4000 behind since it was bought with company funds. I was supplied with the basic Microsoft ergonomic keyboard that has sold for $10 for years now. I just went with it since I'm a pragmatist at heart; it got the characters on the screen and my wrists didn't hurt. But after seeing the 4000 on a deal site for ~$30, I decided to regain the joy I had previously experienced.

When it arrived, I decided to give it a little trial at home. After half an hour or so, it seemed that the H, Y, and M keys did not register under normal pressure. I decided to take it to work anyway since I assumed my changed typing form was to blame. After using it for an entire work day, I was on the phone with the vendor (Amazon seller) telling them they needed to send me a replacement. We cross-shipped, and I got one with 100%-working keys. Finally, back to bliss, I thought.

After a week of using it at work, my wrist pain came back. I couldn't figure it out since I had used the same model keyboard in the same position (roughly) for a few years without problems at my last job. I initially looked at my mouse, but changing its position didn't help. Changed the height on my chair, how I sat, and other variables. As a last resort, I took the elevating attachment off the front. Within three days, the wrist pain was gone again.

Based on using an older unit for a few years and using one bought just months ago, I think the quality level has suffered. A friend also ordered one from the Amazon seller when I did, and he also had to return his first due to defective behavior. The key action seems a lot muddier than I remembered and is definitely slower/softer than the $10 beige wonder I'm typing on now. The space button squeaked rather loudly after using it for a few days, but a can of silicone took care of that.

This has found a place in my secondary office location. Nostalgia might cloud my judgment a little when comparing to my old unit, but for purely typing purposes right now, I prefer the basic ergonomic Microsoft offering to the 4000. If the additional function buttons and scroller appeal to you, you would probably be better off with the 4000.

You might look at other dates of other reviews; I would have given that older unit five stars plus, but the newer one gets three stars for the initial product and four after I removed the elevating attachment and took care of the squeaking.

Pros: ergonomic, several customizable function buttons, scroller in the middle, better home key layout, looks cool.

Cons: keys aren't as responsive as others, raised front might cause wrist problems for some.","Very good, but not perfect",1238371200,

Wooten,"Having been a fan and long user of previous model Microsoft Natural Ergo keyboards, I was glad to see this upgrade and enhancement. It had been a couple of years since using them, so it took a short time to find my way back to experiencing the true advantage of the key placements. Functionally, I am very pleased with this new model. I don't really like the size, but one must put up with such things to get the features that I do like.
On the down side, Microsoft is to be chided for their quality and cost-cutting on this very expensive keyboard. In my many years of professional and continuous keyboard usage, with very cheap to this top-end corded model, I have never experience the wiping out of the key lettering. This began to be noticed after only a couple of months usage. Now, not yet a year old, the ""D"" and ""C"" keys are almost complelely blank, and the ""S"" key is not far behind. Although a touch-typist, I am lost when I must hunt-and-peck for keys. This makes the missing labels most frustrating.",Excellent but...,1237334400,
379301,4.0,,True,"03 16, 2009",A3TU6MXNCAX8F7,B000A6PPOK,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Caril,"I bought this keyboard a few months ago to use at work, primarily to help reduce issues with carpal tunnel, and it has certainly helped.  It took me a day or so to get used to the new layout, but after 3 days I was fully up to speed.

I have not had the problems with the spacebar that other reviewers mentioned, however I do sometimes have to go back and insert an ""n"" - I guess I don't hit that key quite hard enough for it to take all of the time.

My main issue is that some of the letters are wearing off already.  It doesn't bother me specifically, because I do touchtype, but I know it could be problematic for other people, and I'm surprised that they're wearing off so quickly - it took *years* for the same wear to show on previous keyboards.  (Keys affected are E, S, D and C.)  I do a lot of copy-paste via keyboard commands, so that might be partly to blame, but it's still not ideal for a keyboard.

That said, after 4 months of use it is still comfortable, curves naturally, and does not require too much pressure to get accurate typing (with the occasional exception of the ""n"", as mentioned before).  Overall I am happy with this keyboard and, if I had a desktop at home, would buy another one of these to use at home.

2 years later:  The keyboard finally died, but only because I spilled water on it.  Towards the end, most of the key labels had been rubbed off which didn't bother me at all but did confuse other people.  I had to use a regular keyboard for about a week while my replacement (same again!) came in.  I didn't realize how much I used the special function keys until they weren't available, and would probably pay for premium shipping next time to get a replacement quicker.  The only reason I docked a star was the letters wearing off, and that was more for other people than for me.  I'm extremely happy with my keyboard.",Comfortable and easy to use,1237161600,

I still had fond memories of my old MS NATURAL ELITE PRO keyboard I had used writing my Thesis, so I decided on the 4000 model which seemed to be its improved replacement. I have had the keyboard for about two months - here are my impressions:

THE GOOD:
- The 4000 is not just another beautiful keyboard but a REALLY comfortable one too. Not only are the curves natural and well molded but the minimally padded leather-imitation wrist-rest offers a silky sense of luxury. The keyboard comes out of the box with a negative angle attachment, which can easily be removed - it is comfortable but personally I need to see what I am typing.

- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the keys are physically separated into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal. So, if you are thinking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-s-Wave/dp/B000UH8I66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech's Wave</a>, it is a good idea to actually give both of them a try at a local store before making a choice. As I said, I am no professional typist (yes, more of a 2-fingers) yet I found that my typing is much faster and my typos more rare when using Natural keyboards.

- I liked the idea of the BACK/FORWARD buttons at the wrist-rest. Although most mice now have this functions on their side buttons, it is still a big help when browsing (my mouse has a Magnifying Function where the FORWARD usually is).

- Also, this is a really quiet keyboard. You get a satisfactory feeling when pushing a button but instead of an annoying ""clack"" sound only a muted ""tap"" is heard. Ideal if your wife is in the habit of taking naps in your home-office couch.

- As an avid gamer favoring the right side of the keyboard (arrow keys instead of the WASD configuration) I enjoyed the ample room around the former.

- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers)

Now, THE BAD:
- For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT keys are too small! I could do with regular sized ""H"" and ""N"" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER. And this is a large keyboard, I doubt it would make any difference if it was yet a bit longer for that.

- The SPACE bar is, well, fickle. Sometimes it works even if hit at the side. Others it refuses unless hit in the middle.

- The key letters and symbols have a tendency to rub off(!). This is totally unacceptable for a premium priced product - especially one sporting MICROSOFT's brand name. I decided to wait for the problem to become more pronounced and have this one replaced.

- The Media keys on top do not sit well in their homings and are not perfectly aligned. Especially the VOLUME UP in my keyboard seems to rest at an angle. Again, poor quality control for such an expensive and brand name product.

When you press it from left or right, it made a loud crack sound and was very hard to press. You need to press it in the center of it to make the space bar act likes a normal key instead of cheap one. I was going to return it and exchange it with another one because I though it was defected product.
  But I read a online review that this was normal and couldn't not be fix. But since I don't want to go though with mailing back the huge keyboard box with boxed in 2' by 3' box(amazon shipped with a huge brown box). I decided to keep it for a few day.
  I decided to reattach the raise keyboard stand below just to try it out. And it turned out that if you place your hand properly on the raised stand, this is the most comfortable typing style I have ever try it before. you need to put both of your two elbows on the table and type as if you would play with crystal ball like a gypsies.
  That the first improvement I noticed it and I decided to try it for a few more day. I am computer science student and because of my condition I need to use ergonomic wrist glove to type. Every since I found out that how to type properly on the raised stand, I don't need to wear that glove. Now that loud sound from space bar disappeared and space bar act likes rest of the keys. And I don't need to press hard when I press from left or right, it must have grease it self and it sort out itself.
 That is so cool! Before I buy this keyboard I was having hard time choosing between this one and Logitech wave keyboard. I took this for the raise stand I am glad I made that decision.

ergonomic keyboard- very comfortable which is paramount to all the bells and whistles of keyboards.

cons:
1. The space bar requires a bit more effort to press unless you press closer to its center but I doubt anything can be done about that as space bars in general encounter that problem however curved keyboards such as this one exacerbates the problem.

2. lack of multimedia key's- the volume control is nice, and the most important feature to me, and it even has a play/pause button but it would be nicer if it also had a fast forward, rewind, and stop button as well- those two were on the multimedia keyboard.

And since this is a split keyboard, my thumbs don't reach to the middle of the space bar when in the standard typing position.  I had hoped the space key would loosen up to allow my off-center use without requiring so much force to depress it.  It hasn't, and I still find myself correcting missed space typos weeks later.

The good thing about this keyboard is that it allows you type in a more comfortable and natural position.  The wrist rests are a bit softer than my original natural ergo keyboard.

If you use this for typing out letters, amazon reviews, and essays, you will do just fine.  That's because your two thumbs will rest in the center of the SPACEBAR.  This is enough force to get desired response.

If you use the keyboard for typing and game playing, then you will have an issue with this keyboard.  That's because a gamer will most likely press the SPACEBAR key from the sides and that will cause a sticking seesaw motion with the key.

I purchased the 4000 and tried it out as a replacement. The keyboard is huge. If you are using a computer desk with a slide out keyboard tray, this monster will either scrape underneath the desk or not fit in at all when you try to slide it back in.

There are lots of bells and whistles such as programmable keys and the sort, but these are more of a gimmick than anything else. The key response and placement are ok, but it's easy to mistype because of the angle of the keys.

After two days, I returned this keyboard. It has a nice wrist cushion, but overall, the feel of the keys, the unwieldy over-sized footprint, and flimsy keys don't add up to a very good typing experience. The Microsoft Natural Elite runs circles around the 4000.

The Microsoft Natural Ergo 4000 seem to fit the bill functionally and financially. So far so good.  Adapting to the new layout and shape of the keyboard was easy. And so far, no more pain.","No More Pain, So Far",1218585600,

Namely, my fingers went numb in five minutes of playing! Mild carpal tunnel syndrome is the cause; not severe enough for treatment, but bad enough to make my fingers go numb.

Rather than quitting playing guitar, I decided to start by replacing my keyboard with a MS Natural Ergo Keyboard. And it has made all the difference in the world. Since I started using the keyboard, I have only had finger numbness once, and that was after prolonged driving rather than typing. I think it safe to say that this keyboard has completely solved my symptoms, without forcing me to quit music.

It has a nice comfortable built-in wrist rest, covered with comfortable leatherette. You can raise the front or the back of the keyboard with the supplied support, but I recommend raising the back (side closest to your belly). Between the support at the back, the downward angle between halves of the split keyboard, the outward cant of the keys, and the curved ""gull wing"" key positions, you will find your hands are held at totally natural and comfortable angles that totally avoid wrist stress. Since this is why most of us buy the keyboard, it does this job extremely well.

The keyboard itself is well thought-out, with keys to do every function you could ever want. The row of F keys across the top are dual-function like earlier models, but unlike earlier models the ""F lock"" now stays on between restarts. So, once you make the keys map to their standard F-key mapping, the keyboard remembers that setting. USUALLY. Occasionally the F-lock setting will reset: you know because you'll hit F-keys and the applications will start complaining that they don't recognize the command you're typing. To help with recognition of this situation, the ""locked"" lights are right down between your thumbs: Caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, and F lock.

It also has two interesting features between the halves of the keyboard: back/forward buttons and a ""Zoom"" slider. The back/forward buttons, which you click with your thumbs, work great for web page navigation, although I find sometimes the ""back"" button goes back more than one web page. The zoom slider, on the other hand, is totally worthless. It is inconsistently supported by applications, and not really very useful to start out with. Fortunately, the keyboard is fully programmable, and a little searching (google for Josh Highland's blog entry called ""hacking the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000"") discovered a handy script you can install to convert the useless ""zoom"" slider into a highly functional ""scroll"" slider. I love it. Now you don't have to keep going back to the mouse to scroll up and down pages.

There are also programmable keys at the top, including calculator, play/pause, no speaker, and ""My favorites."" I have not used many of these, but thankfully the web-oriented ones respect your default browser so you can use firefox instead of IE. They might be handy for some people.

One caution: when you plug it in, you will wonder how you will ever learn to type on it. You'll be convinced that somebody has applied a security device that keeps you from doing any work. Don't worry, you'll learn. The first day I had serious productivity problems; by the second working day, I was fine with it. I should note that if you are a fast typist but not a touch typist, you probably will have some problems. The only lingering problems I have are bad habits I had picked up over 30 years of programming such as sometimes reaching across to hit the ""Y"" with my left index finger.

I figured that maybe a Microsoft keyboard that said ""Vista certified"" on the box might give me less problems. To be honest, I'd never really thought about the ergonomic aspect before.

My initial thoughts were that this keyboard seems very well made and sturdy.

But what has impressed me most of all is the ergonomic design. They have obviously given a tremendous amount of thought and research into laying out these keys - and what a result!

Microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard 4000 - advanced ergonomic design
Model:1048

Reasons:
1. It is not ergonomic design by any means
2. spacebar is hard to press when you actually type .
3. your fingers/wrist might experience pain if you use this; It happened to me.

you won't understand what i say if you simply try this keyboard in stores. you actually need to type a document using this and u will know why the keys make it hard to type. it is amount of pressure needed to type a key is different when u press them individually vs while typing a document when all fingers are in use.-

Don't know which ergonomic evaluator approved such wiered keyboard.

I would give it ZERO stars if I could.

Suggestsions for Microsoft:
1. split the space bar into two buttons to atleast make this keyboard usable.
2. reduce finger pressure required to press all keys specifically spacebar.
3. increase the size of enter button. and reduce size of most keys.",Microsoft should recall this keyboard,1212019200,

I'd recommend not installing the software that comes with it, and just forgo the ""zoom"" control and a couple other bells and whistles. If you want those, don't buy Microsoft.

Pluses:
Good touch, I'm a fast typist and even with my advancing arthritis, I haven't slowed much with this keyboard. On a 'straight' keyboard I can now only go about 20 wpm, here, I can do my old 50-70 wpm. Keys are about where you expect them to be, and even with a couple years' wear, this keyboard is holding up well. It really is good hardware.

Minuses:
Lots of crevices that catch junk. You need something like a playing card to periodically clean them.

Now the software: The software is a train wreck. It messes up the zoom settings and window scroll settings on my Dell dual-core laptop when it's undocked. Rebooting doesn't help. If you open an Excel sheet, it  immediately zooms to 400%. Unzoom it, and what the hey, it zooms right back to 400% again. Scroll bars act the same. Everything wants to be up at the top, regardless of where I set it. And if you have a Logitech mouse, it won't work right with Microsoft's software as it just installs itself over the top of anything you had previously configured perfectly.

Conclusion:
Good keyboard, very good hardware; but the software is invasive. Don't install the software. Thanks, Microsoft.

Why only 2 stars? Uninstalling Microsoft's software trashed my built-in laptop keyboard's drivers. (It disabled them!) So when I rebooted, I had NO keyboard at all!

I'm a business systems programmer and after a few years of crunching away on the keyboards that get thrown in with the computer, my fingers started to get some telltale aches.  This keyboard certainly did a good job of alleviating those aches - between the natural wrist and key angles and the soft, pliant action of the keys, the Ergo 4000 is a really comfortable keyboard to type on.  It was the finger equivalent going from a stiff high school desk chair to a Lay-Z-Boy.  You notice immediately that the (semi-satisfying) snap and sharp action of standard keyboard keys is replaced with a near-silent, soft feel.  The wrist support is also surprisingly comfortable, lined with some kind of soft rubber.  It might be different if you're used to a standard keyboard, but your fingers will thank you.  I also found the range of application and document launching shortcuts that line of the top of the keyboard quite handy, saving a little bit of mouse work.

I must say that after a year and a half of good service, my original Ergo became useless when a single letter stopped working.  Prior to that (and on the replacement keyboard I bought), there hadn't any hint of a mechanical problem - every key working as smoothly as the day I bought it.

I bought this keyboard hoping that it would relieve the strain placed on my wrists by typing. So far it has worked wonderfully. I can type on this keyboard for long periods of time without discomfort, whereas five minutes with a normal keyboard used to cause immense pain in my wrists.

My only complaint is that the spacebar was a lot firmer at first than I expected. It has become slightly easier to press with time, but not by much. This may only be the case for some of the keyboards, as the one that I played around with at the store (same model) seemed to have a looser spacebar.

Also, be aware that the keyboard is pretty tall (which is necessary for it to tilt slightly backward and be comfortable to use) and may not allow your keyboard tray to retract fully into the table. This slight inconvenience, however, is well worth the superior comfort that this keyboard provides for your wrists.

I used this keyboard for a couple of months after buying it, but eventually my RSI got worse and I stopped using a computer altogether. I've recently begun to use a computer again under the supervision of a physical therapist, and the keyboard that I use is a Goldtouch Soft Touch keyboard (GTN0077-ST). This keyboard is better than the Microsoft 4000 in three ways: 1) The keys, including the space-bar, are much easier to press (requiring only 45 g of force); 2) The amount the keyboard is split and raised is adjustable; 3) There is no number pad which allows the mouse to be placed closer to the center (requiring less reaching and strain).","Very comfortable, but the spacebar takes a little getting used to",1200960000,

I concluded that I'd get used to it if it was really as bad as claimed (and I presumed that others were being a bit dramatic about the problem).

Well, to my surprise, it does take an unexpectedly strong stroke to get a space compared to the other keys.  But, yes, I have gotten used to it.  The biggest issue is that there is a bit of play in the spacebar, so you have to get accustomed to pushing through that first bit, then really whacking it to get the space you wanted.  (Take ""whack"" with a grain of salt -- it is just a keyboard key, it's not like you need to swing a hammer and hope for the best.)

I actually find the Zoom feature kind of nice.  The other ""extra"" keys haven't gotten much use yet, but as I ramp up the keyboard's use for work -- and Excel -- I think I'll really like the extra numeric keypad keys (parens and equals).

I've been using it now for two weeks and have determined that the problem is due to the curvature of the keyboard. The farther away from the center of the spacebar you that you tap it, the stiffer it is and is thus less responsive. If you happen to tap it closer to the middle, then it's fine.

I'm a programmer and I type all day long and use the entire keyboard (function keys and all the puntuation that comes with writing code). After I had a chance to use an ergonomic keyboard for a couple months w/o any pain, I finally purchased the Ergo 4000. I love it.

As for a couple specifics, the last ergonomic keyboard I used had an enlarged delete key. The home, end and page keys were normal size. I never got completely used to it and was glad when the Ergo 4000 came with a normal cluster as I use those keys alot.

Also, as is typical, this keyboard has a function lock key that can toggle between the standard function keys and special programmed shortcuts. I use the function keys alot and never use the special functions, so I was also pleasently surprised to discover that function lock is turned on by default. So when I first boot up and login, I don't have to remember to turn the function lock on.

The only con I can come up with is that there is only a single ""Windows"" shortcut key located on the left side.

I struggled for several days last year with the MS Ergo Keyboard 4000's USB connection -- trying to get it to work through a high-quality Raritan KVM switch (which has PS/2 connectors for mouse and keyboard, no USB), and finally gave up.

I *really* wanted to make it work, since I love many things about that keyboard, but I have to go through KVMs (and I already have a HUGE investment in the Raritan PS/2 equipment, so it would cost a small fortune to replace that with USB KVM equipment).

I thought that it should be possible to make it work -- especially because I have used many other USB keyboards and USB mice with my KVMs.

I tried many things including:

(1) Several different brands of the little USB-to-PS2 and PS2-to-USB convertor/adapters (these are the little green or purple ones, about 1.5"" long that sell for about $3-4 US),

(2) Several of the more ""upscale"" USB-to-PS2 converter/adapters/splitters, such as the kind used for connecting keyboard and mouse to a laptop that has only one connector for external keyboard and mouse (these are about 6""-10"" long, usually having a small nodule-thingie in the middle, with 1 cable about 3"" on one side, and 2 cables about 3"" long on the other side, and sell for about $10.00),

(3) Some high-end USB-to-PS2 converter/adapter/splitter/emulators, like the laptop converter/splitter described above, but additionally having electronics which emulate a mouse (so that, when using a KVM and you switch it from computer A to computer B, Computer A still thinks it has a mouse attached).  (Since the USB connector on these is male, and the USB connector on the MS 4000 keyboard is male, you have to use a F-F gender changer between them). These sell for about $50-150.00.

(4) Praying

(5) Holding my breath and contorting my mouth into unusual shapes,

none of which worked.

I cannot understand WHY it is not possible to get this keyboard to work through USB-to-PS2 converters.  I posted questions in a few online forums about this, but have never gotten any answers.

Since then, I have discovered that there are also a few USB mouses (both wired and wireless) made by Microsoft, which similarly do not work with the KVMs, converters/adapters, splitters/emulators.  (But I have some earlier models of Microsoft USB mice which do work -- such as the  Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0).

I have reluctantly resigned myself to the fact that the MS 4000 Ergo keyboard is not going to be possible for me with my KVM setups.

But -- still I would like to know the reason WHY?!?!  What is Microsoft doing differently with their USB?

It appears to be yet another instance where Microsoft ignores well-established international standards, and designs things they way they think is ""better"", to hell with compatibility with the rest of the world's manufacturer's devices.

But, what is it that Microsoft is doing differently, which they apparently think is better than the USB standard?  What are we gaining from this difference?

Microsoft won't answer this question.  I've sent it to a few of the computer-tech magazines, but they don't seem to be sufficiently interested in the problem to provide an answer.

I would be most grateful if there is someone here who could enlighten us as to the ""WHY"" of this incompatibility.

Microsoft does not provide replacement keys, but has replaced the keyboards when I complained. However, I'm sick of complaining. I've used a Microsoft Ergo 4000 for about 1-1/2 years.

For anyone who spends a lot of time on their computer, ergonomics is a very important consideration when making hardware purchases.  Split key design seems to be the first thing an ergo keyboard should have, but the rest of the design is probably just preferece.  My Kinesis has concaved keys, which is hard to describe, but just imagine putting the keys inside two cereal bowls set apart by a few inches.  This promotes better alignment of your wrists so that they don't need to bend upwards.  The split prevents your wrists from bending sideways.  The MS Natural Ergo KB 4000 finally adds the feature of keeping your wrists from bending up by providing a removeable reverse slope attachment.  Some people may not like this but for me, it's a must.  Also keep in mind that with the reverse slope attachment, your keyboard may not fit under your desk if you're using a keyboard tray.  Mine doesn't.

The keys feel so great when you type and make very little noise.  The wrist rest material feels very smooth and cushy, unlike a lot of cheap plastic wrist rest attachments that some keyboards come with.  I like having a lot of extra buttons on the keyboard so that I don't have to use my mouse as much.  The mouse is the worst ergonomic invention ever.  It has ruined many a wrists.  I have 2 MS Digital Media Pro keyboards that I love as well and wish that the Ergo 4000 had two additional keys that my old KB had.  The Log Off and Sleep buttons were great as I could shut down my machine or switch user without having to use the mouse and click on confirm buttons.  I also wish you could reprogram the zoom button to be a scroll button.

All in all, this is a one fantastic keyboard.  My only small complaint is the lack of some buttons that I liked on their old keyboards.  Also, you should feel very comfortable buying hardware from Microsoft.  I've only ever had to call Microsoft hardware support twice in my life and both times they sent me replacements for my defective/broken items (one mouse and one keyboard) without hassle.",One more positive review,1171238400,

So far, I do like it for the comfort.  It does take getting used to, however, but when you adjust, you won't want to go back to a regular keyboard.

The keyboard is sloped on both sides to make it easier to type, compared to just the regular kind that everyone uses.  The extender that comes with it can be detached, but it's only for people who want to type in a downward angle.  I had no use for it, so I took that off.

Customizing the buttons is very simple. The Back/Forward buttons on the bottom can be changed to Previous/Next if you want to use them for your media players, which is what I did.  The 5 buttons at the top can be programed to open applications or your Favorites. Sadly the Zoom scroller only zooms in on the text instead of scrolling up and down on web pages. Very sad waste of what could have been a very useful key.

I guess my only gripe about this keyboard is the the spacebar really needs a good pounding before it starts to loosen up.  Even as I type this now, I'm still missing some space strokes from time to time.  Also, this keyboard doesn't come with a PS2 adapter, nor will it work for one either.  Make sure you have an open USB slot because that's all it has to plug into your computer.  I didn't mind that at all since I have several unused slots.

I use mine every day and have yet to feel any discomfort.

What would make this keyboard perfect? Back-lit keys and if the zoom thing in the middle was a scroll for web browsing. None of the back-lit keyboards are anywhere near as comfortable and I have yet to see any keyboard with a scroll control in the middle so this is still my all time favorite keyboard. If the keyboard was wireless and had a mini trackball like on server rack style keboards, I'd probably use the keyboard while lying down in bed and hook up a large screen TV as the monitor. The keyboard is also very comfortable in your lap.

I especially love the parentheses ( ) above the keypad. Makes typing my phone number so much easier. The layout of all the keys really is the best I have seen on any keyboard by any manufacturer. I also find myself using the ""back"" button under the space bar while web surfing. Saves me the trouble of having to reach for the mouse or the ""backspace"" key.

After thinking I might have carpal tunnel (it turned out to be something different), I purchased this keyboard because it appeared to be the best thing available without getting into some very expensive (and very weird) configurations.

I have been very pleased with this product in every respect - so pleased that I bought one for my office as well as my home.

PROS:

- Five totally programmable buttons for launching programs, actions, or websites I use frequently

- Highly ergonomic

- Excellent padded support for the heels of the hands

- Zoom and webpage navigation buttons

- Easy-to-see, well-placed lights on the keyboard for caps lock, function lock, scroll lock, and number lock

- Nice selection of pre-programmed shortcut keys (calculator, web, search, mail) that can be re-mapped to other actions if desired

- Very solid construction...good heft to the keys and just the right amount of tactile feedback.  It does not feel ""cheap.""

- Good adherance to my work surface/desktop.  It does not slide around.

- Rugged.  I've used mine for well over a year with absolutely no problems.

- Color: hides dirt and is stylish.

CONS:

- Not available as wireless

- Not enough controls for CD player (only play/pause...would like eject, FFWD, Track, etc.)

I will warn those who have not used an ergonomic keyboard that it takes some getting used to.  But after you have used it for awhile, ""conventional"" keyboards will feel awkward and cramped, and you'll notice the unnatural angle that they force upon your wrists.

I have used several ergo keyboards over the years and can categorically say that this is the best of the bunch.  Microsoft is the leader in the ergo keyboard market, and they've obviously spent money studying the biomechanics of what makes for a good design.  However, while many of their keyboards have the familiar v-shaped split to the character keys, none have the sting-ray like curved profile of this keyboard, and that is what makes all the difference.

As I mentioned above, I thought at one time that I might have carpal tunnel, but it turned out to be an unrelated problem.  However, I am very happy that I switched to this keyboard anyway.  With as much time as I spend at the computer each day, this keyboard may very well have PREVENTED me from getting carpal tunnel.  I use it in conjunction with a Logitech wireless laser mouse (MX-1000) that I love as well and which I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.

If Microsoft would address the few CONS that I outlined above, I think they would have the perfect keyboard.  But as it stands, it's close enough to perfection for me and I have absolutely no regrets about the purchase.

The keys do not feel stiff at all, they're light, very quiet, and responsive (for the most part--see below).  Space bar is not an issue for me at all.

What IS an issue is the M and N key don't always register, at least on my particular unit.  I'm typing along, and one of my words is ""missig"" the N.  And for some reason, the N key is the loudest key on the keyboard.  Also, on one occasion, the "")"" key stopped working entirely.  I could type a ""0"", but holding shift to get "")"" didn't work.  Rebooting fixed it..very odd.

The IntellimouseExplorer 4.0 is my choice for the mouse and without a doubt, this 4000 is my choice for keyboards. I was skeptical at first with the reverse tilt thing but it took seconds, literally seconds, to feel that I *must* be burried with this keyboard.

I am pleast that it is not cluttered with a bunch of custom keys and that in this verion Microsoft backed away from its cooky big-Delete key layout. The f-lock is also OFF by default with this (it might be the software doing that) which is great if you hate the f-lock as much as the rest of the world.

It's a rather quiet keyboard. I pound keys all day long so it's pleasant for people around me to have one that doesn't have to actually ""click"" when I type a letter. I was a little bothered that it was wired and not wireless, but I am over that now - I prefer not thinking about the battery, to be honest.

Finally, this keyboard is ergonomic exactly how you want it to be. If you are not a split keyboard kinda person then just count on a week or two until you are skilled with it. The difference is very pleasant and the results to your wrist are noticable.

I never had wrist problems but I switched to ergo keyboards anyway because I am smart. You should be to; you just feel more relaxed at the end of the day. It's like luxury.

I used the original Microsoft Natural for more than 10 years keyboard until it wore out.  I moved it from computer.  I loved the layout but was never thrilled by the stiffness of the keys.

Microsoft has done it with this keyboard.

Great feel.  The keys have just the right resistance before they get the detent.  In fact, it feels a little like the original IBM PC keyboard (circa 1982) which was outstanding, but a bit clicky.

Generally, the keys are sized properly, However, the [7/&] key and the [`/~] are oversized, but that is to get the nearby keys into the right position for touch typists.

The keys are the correct size; they are not cramped like a laptop nor are they so spread out that you have to type looking at the keyboard.

It has a removable front platform as well as the more traditional pop-up feet in the rear.  This give you the ability adjust the angle to suit your needs.  One downside is that the front platform, being removable, can be easily lost.

This is the one for me.

For those not used to a ""natural"" keyboard, I will add my experience.  I went from a consistently typing 90 wpm to 120 in the first month.  Combine that with the elimination of any wrist, shoulder and neck pain and you have the ideal setup.

I have two of these keyboards; one is at work, the other at home.  I have mild RSI in some of my fingers and this keyboards helps alleviate the pain.

The layout of keys is very comfortable for me.  The keys are soft and very quiet.  In a typical office environment, coworkers cannot hear your type - something I wish more keyboard manufacturers took into account.  It shouldn't wake up your roommate, either.

They extreme layout of the keys takes a little getting used to.  It took me an afternoon's work to get it.  The keys, especially the spacebar, take a different about of force that I was used to.

There aren't a disfiguring mass of shortcut keys crammed into the top and sides of the keyboard.  There are a few web/program shortcut keys, and a delightfully minimalist set of media center controls.

If you don't have much real estate on your desk, this may not be the keyboard for you.  Especially be wary of roll-out keyboard trays if you keep the raiser attached. It's significantly taller than just about any other non-'Natural' keyboard.

The software that comes with the keyboard is not very flexible, and doesn't allow reprogramming of the slider that lies between your hands.  I don't have a need for a 'Zoom' function, and this bothered me.  I found that some experimentation with an application called AutoHotkey ([...]) allows me to customize the keyboard to my liking.

My dissapointments are as follows:
1. My Dell precision M70 will not boot up with the keyboard plugged in. I have to unplug it, let Windows load, and then plug it back in.
2. The very first time I launch Firefox, the Zoom function will go crazy and totally zoom out on my screen. I then have to ""unzoom"" it back to normal.
3. The keys are not as ""soft"" as my previous Microsoft Natural Elite for CTX. I have some carpal tunnel in my hands, and while the pain from using this keyboard is noticeable, it is not unbearable.

Conclusion: I am going to keep this as my home keyboard, for casual use. I would not recommend it for work because of all the hassles involved.

Comfort. The most comfortable keyboard I've used. The curves take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. Even the (suede-covered and padded) palm rest is subtly curved (in 3 dimensions!) to fit your hand exactly right. A removable prop allows for negative tilt, if that suits your fancy (it's a lot more comfortable than it first seems it should be). Overall, there's a reason they call the design ""natural."" Every aspect is perfectly suited to the way my hands naturally go.

Buttons. Standard 101-key layout plus some handy extras. Top row gives you quick access to frequently used programs. There are buttons for your web browser, the search panel (a sidebar in a folder window to search for files and such), and email. Next to that are five ""favorites"" buttons, which you can easily program to open any programs or run any command line you like. The * button below them brings up a window that reminds you of the current settings and lets you change or update them. Next to that are a mute button, volume up and down, play/pause, and calculator. You can also reprogram any of the buttons to serve a different function if it so suits you. Above the number pad is a row with =() and backspace keys, which make for convenient additions. At the bottom, just below the spacebar, are a pair of unobtrusive keys which function as back and forward browser buttons. All in all, these extra buttons are quickly spoiling me. They save a lot of mousing around.

Zoom Slider. Supposedly, it lets you zoom in or out on just about any window. It doesn't work exactly as advertized for me (I'm using XP Pro), but I don't mind. With Firefox, it works as a scroll stick. In IE, it tries to simultaneously scroll and zoom. Text gets bigger or smaller as you move up and down the page. It's kind of funny, but not really useful. Not a big deal, though, as scrolling in IE can be easily accomplished with the mouse or arrow keys. The slider does work perfectly in WordPad, smoothly adjusting the text size up or down with the touch of a finger.

Construction:

The plastic is a good balance between lightweight and durable. It's not featherweight, but it's significantly lighter than a lot of older keyboards. Even so, it still feels reassuringly solid.

One thing I did notice is that my favorite corner of the spacebar (where my right thumb rests) wore smooth within a day. The key is intact, and the other keys are still in pretty much perfect condition, but the thin traction coating rubbed off in that spot.

Typing Volume:

It's not whisper-quiet, but it's not embarassingly or disruptively loud, either. Slightly softer than average, I'd say. A bit louder than my laptop's built-in keyboard (which has the advantage of flatter keys and a solid surface beneath it, both of which reduce echoes).

Layout:

One commenter mentioned the oversized TGBYHN keys. That's actually fairly standard with split keyboards. It's just that most of them make those keys into plateaus, with the extra space at base level. I actually like this way better. It's got a cleaner look, and the keys work just fine no matter where I hit them.

Summary: If you like split keyboards, go with this one! The worst thing about it is how much you'll miss it when you have to use a different one.","Ooo, comfy!",1149638400,

After some careful research, I decided to purchase this keyboard, and I'm not disappointed. This keyboard is extremely comfortable, the keys are very 'soft' the wrist wrest comfortable and the position of all the keys quite natural.

I use a computer for a fair amount of the day; at work, and especially at home. I do a lot of communication online, and I have found that when I use a traditional straight keyboard for a long time, my fingers turn to mush. I can't push the keys right, and my wrists hurt terribly.

I decided to invest in a quality keyboard that was designed for comfort and long term use. I looked around, and I found this one. I bought it, and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. There are really alot of selling points that this keyboard has. You can tell that Microsoft had really thought about putting comfort first. For example, this keyboard comes with a built-in (and I mean really BUILT-IN) pad for your wrists. The material that this is made of is really excellent; it provides an excellent amount of comfort without feeling too soft.

The keys on this are the best quiet type that I know of. You can barely hear any clicking at all. They also provide good tactile feedback--neither to hard or too soft. My only complaint here is that the spacebar is too hard out of the box. You really have to push it down in order for it to register. I hope that it becomes easier with continued use, but for right now, it is a little too stiff.

The keys are designed to slope with the natural position of your fingers on the keyboard. This makes it more comforatble to work with, because you don't necessarily have to readjust your fingers to get the right key response. The reach to some of the keys are a little strange until you get used it them. For example, the enter key is shorter than it used to be. So if your natural reach would get you to the inside edge of the enter key before, you will have a bit of a stretch in order to get to it. The backspace, shift, ctrl, caps lock, and tab all also have more reach required to get to them. With a little practice, however, it becomes much easier to hit them.

The enhanced keys on this keyboard are really easy to use. They provide extra functionality and are simple to program. You get five favorite keys, which you can set to open folders, files, web pages, or whatever you want. You also get keys to increase or decrease the volume, open your home page, search, email, and even a key for the caclulator. In this keyboard, the enhanced F keys are great, and you don't have to reset the F-lock after each reboot. Over the number pad, there are some commonly used keys like equals, back and forward parentheses, and backspace. To some, this will make using the calculator easier. I don't mind them, but I wished that they could have put more functionable keys instead of those because they seem a bit redundant to me.

There are also back and forward keys for use with the internet. I love these, because now I don't have to use the mouse to go backward or forward when I am surfing the net. I wish the zoom slider had been a scroll button, though. I don't really ever use the zoom function.

One plus of this keyboard is that the basic special function keys are labeled for you. So you can see that the ctrl key has the asterisk, and that means that when you press ctrl and any key that has the asterisk on it, the function that is labeled by the key will occur.

The unique ergonomics of this keyboard make it far superior than any natural keyboard that I have used. The reverse slope is genius. Turns out that the older design of keyboards was a carryover from the typewriters that needed a ton of finger pressure to use. Microsoft did a ton of research to find a new orientation for the keys, and it worked wonderfully. The slope allows me to type better and easier, while giving me full support for my wrists.

This is really a revolutionary keyboard. I don't have the space to describe how great it is. You just have to try it and see for yourself how unique it is.

I bought this new one because the one I used to have doesn't have USB interface. Compared with the old one, this one has three differences:

1. Arrangements of insert, delete, home, end, page up and down keys. Microsoft decided to change them back to the layout of ""normal"" keyboards. This might be good for some people, but not for someone who's used to the new layout (you can call that layout weird, but I found it pretty good once I got used to it).

2. This keyboard is raised. I thought it would be too high for me and would seem unnatural, but it turns out to be pretty comfortable.

3. The keyboard is split in the middle, with an angle. However, as they move towards the edge (The ctrl, shift, enter, etc keys), they become parallel again. This was not true for the old natural multimedia keyboard. I actually found this to be not as good as the old one. This is because I can have a natural wrist angle when I'm typing on most of the keys, but whenever I want to press the ctrl keys, I have to bend my wrist outwards to press them, which is extra movement I do not want, and would make my hands tired pretty soon. If I do not use the raiser, my wrist would have to bend a lot to press those keys. This really hurts. (that's why I need the raiser, which alleviates the problem, but still doesn't solve it) I don't know why MS decided to do this, but I actually find the layout of their old product better.

The multimedia keys are pretty handy though.

If you've never used this type of keyboard before, it will take a little time, like a week or two to get used to the placement of keyes, but I'm sure you will be enjoying it more and more every day. Soft tactile response is exceptionally pleasant. The zoom slider would be excellent, if it always worked as intended (see below).

Cons: I bought this keyboard to be sure it's compatible with my new 64-bit system. My reasoning was, if the 64-bit Windows are created by Microsoft and this keyboard is designed by Microsoft, the two must fit each other perfectly. Well, this is not exactly the case.

Apparently Microsoft was too busy to design a native 64-bit driver for their keyboards. The driver that comes with this keyboard works with both the 32 and 64-bit Windows, but functionality in the 64- bit OS is limited. You can type fine and most function keys work as intended, but you can not use the volume up/down function even with the Microsoft Media Player in the 64-bit Windows, as it won't work. Also the zoom slider works fine in the MS Word and most IE browsing situations, but does not work with the 64-bit Mozilla (Deer Park version) and even in IE sometimes starts acting strange (such as suddenly becoming a scroll wheel, instead of a zoom). I guess, Microsoft shouldn't complain that many software and hardware companies ignore the 64-bit version of Windows, as they themselves keep ""forgetting"" about it.

Another small drawback is that the ""Enter"" key is a bit too small for comfort. But I got used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.

My conclusion: This is a fantastic keyboard for anyone who types a lot. It literally makes typing a joy. Let's hope its functionality in Windows XP Pro x64 OS will be upgraded with a new native 64-bit driver in the near future.","Great typing keyboard, but...",1137888000,

When the keyboard is set up properly (forearms  parallel to the floor  see site [...] ), the Ergo is extremely kind to your wrists and the best I have EVER used. The lift can be removed but please try to use it, the negative tilt is a terrific ergo device.

The second improvement is that the keys are much better. They take to edge hits much better than the old keyboard. There are also a lot less noisy than the Pro. (There is indeed a dead spot on the extreme  upper corners of the space bar but I have NEVER noticed it- I have to contort my thumbs just to hit the spacebar like that and is a very unnatural).

The third improvement is the wealth of special keys, especially the favorites key and the F lock and num lock keys that remembers their settings. The favorites can start a program that you choose while the other silver keys can do commands (like copy, paste, and exit). The back/forward buttons I find pretty much useless as I have these set up on my mouse. The zoom key is used to change text size which works well for my old trifocal eyes.

Negatives? Pretty large keyboard,  black, and the wrist rest is padded but not a cushy as my old gel one.

However, after a few days of using this newly redesigned keyboard, I was extremely disappointed and had to exchange it for a standard logitech keyboard.

First, this keyboard is very large. This really isn't a problem. However, the tiny plastic feet that support the back of the keyboard can barely support it's weight. Any pressure on these feet will cause them to bend or break. Once looking at them, you'll easily see why.

Second, it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room, they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key! Add this to the fact that the keys feel ""squishy"" and you've got one crazy typing experience. It certainly does not feel natural at all. I really did try to get use to this, but I kept finding myself pressing incorrect keys, or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key.

The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch. But for media playback, it has a Play/Pause button, and that's it. No next, forward, back, or even a stop button. For no apparent reason, they are simply nowhere to be found.

Now, it does feel comfortable (even though you can barely type at half your normal typing speed), and it looks great. And that's where the compliments end. I even had 2 other friends try out the keyboard, and they agreed... it's just not natural.

Pros:

- It looks great in black/silver

- Comfortable to rest your hands on the keyboard

- Keyboard has a good solid feel (excluding feet).

Cons:

- The tiny plastic feet are useless

- Some letters on keyboard are larger than others (annoying)

- Keys feel way too soft and offer no feedback

- Missing extra media controls

While this keyboard may be ""comfortable"" and looks nice, it's just not practical for daily use if the feet break, the keys feel strange, and it slows down your typing experience. I'd suggest going with an older microsoft ergo keyboard or sticking with a standard keyboard.",Returned keyboard within 1 week,1134432000,

Do yourself a favor and avoid cordless technology (bluetooth especially) when it comes to keyboards.  A cordless mouse is a solid choice--but a cordless keyboard--what's the big gain there anyway?  They shut down all the time to save power, there's often a lag--and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  After a little reading on the subject you'll understand why corded, for now, is the way to go for keyboards.

In my experience, Logitech makes the best mice and Microsoft makes the best keyboards.  Logitech's designs are getting stranger and stranger while Microsoft is focusing on what's worked on previous designs (related to *keyboards*) and have made some smart improvements.  I'd be shocked if you were very disappointed with this item unless the ""wave"" design is simply not for you.

Mice though--different story.  Microsoft still has the cheapo, lightweight thing going on those.  Another reason to buy just this and go with another mouse.",Yep--stick with corded (and microsoft) for keyboards,1132531200,

It's got several nice changes over many other keyboards in the Natural range:

- Regular layout for the Home, End, Delete, etc. keys block. (This can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on how long you've been using the Microsoft proprietary layout.)

- Very nice key feedback: soft and quiet, but a very clear response.

- ""Tilt-down"" just like the very early models (and some competitor models) used to have. This is definitely the most ergonomic keyboard in a while. Note that you can easily remove the tilt down piece, if you choose to.

Getting used to the slightly different key layout (the keys arch up on each side of the split) took a few hours, but is working great for me now.

This keyboard is large though. It is practically too big for my keyboard drawer: the keyboard does not fully emerge from under the desk and I cannot close my keyboard drawer anymore.

The additional keys above the numeric keypad are remarkably handy. Microsoft added the =, (, ) and backspace keys. When using the calculator (or Excel), these keys really do speed up the data entry process.

However, the very best feature is just a small change I've been hoping for ever since Microsoft re-assigned the function keys to have a dual action, depending on the F-Lock status. The F-Lock status is now on by default, which means that hitting F5 now refreshes your Windows Explorer view instead of opening the selected file.

I used it to replace a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. The wrist/palm rests feel very nice, and I like the fact that the keys are quiet - I'm trying to train myself to take notes while on the phone using the computer instead of using a pad of paper, and I find that loud typing while I'm talking on the phone can interfere with my hearing the other person, and with their perception of my attention. The software does seem relatively Spartan but to be honest I'm not a big user of customization features, so it doesn't impact my use of the device. In the past, I haven't even bothered to install keyboard driver software. The zoom feature works nicely in Firefox, I don't use IE much.

So, for my use - standard typing for many hours/day, minimal use of special features - it's a great keyboard. I'm glad it's got the older-style cursor key/insert-delete-scroll key setup, rather than the setup used on the Natural Elite, that I never did really become accustomed to.

Chances are pretty good I'll buy another one to use at home this weekend - I am really happy with this, enough so that I'm ready to give up the old ergo keyboard I've got at home that doesn't have the negative tilt but does have the arrow-key configuration that I prefer.

I realize that split keyboards are interesting to a minority of the population (and everyone should use what works best for them) - but if you're one of the split keyboard people, I suggest giving this one a try.",Very happy with the keyboard,1130457600,

This would have been the perfect keyboard (natural shape, normal insert/delete/home/end/pgup/pgdown arrows and wheel). On the M$ website, it says that Internet Explorer supports zooming, but it hardly does. It might be a mistake (I think not), but Firefox supports the zoom feature much better than IE but its not listed. Maybe their scared to lose IE clients b/c of people who purchase their keyboard.

Getting it set up was pretty dumb. I installed the software, shutdown, swapped keyboards, booted and I couldn't log in. I had to shut down the computer again and boot with both keyboards so Windows would recognize the Microsoft keyboard after it booted up. I wonder what those 4 loading screens do if not load drivers that I just installed. Anyways, I checked Microsoft update to see if there was a critical update or security patch for the keyboard and luckily there wasn't. I actually hoped there would be something to allow us to map zoom to scroll.

The keys are also a bit stiff. Especially the spacebar and some of the keys that the right pinky hits. I feel like I'm going to get more tired by typing on this than on my old keyboard but I'll just have to wait and see.

On the upside, this keyboard does look very nice and feels very good to rest my palms on the cushioned pad. I also love the sound that the 1-5 ""Favorite"" buttons make when they aren't defined.

HUANG,"From the pictures it looks like the same, poor placement of the ""6"" key that Microsoft continues in all of their ""ergonomic"" keyboards that have a small separation between the left and right handed keys.

If you ever go to a typing class, read a book on typing, or do a computer typing program, the 6 key should be pressed by the right hand.  Microsoft never seems to learn that and puts it on the left side of this keyboard.  I even called them up and created an enhancement request for it years ago, but they don't seem to be able to get their thumbs out to do it correctly.

The overall keyboard feels smooth and the keys are easier to use than a square keyboard. However, everytime that I need to press the 6 key, I have to relearn where it ""is"" as oppose to where it ""should"" be. If you learn typing correctly, be cognizant that the 6 key is a constant nuissance. Microsoft makes a wavey and contineous ergonomic keyboard that is ""as"" comfortable.

Ridiculous as this sounds, if you ever try to press the ""6"" correctly as most typing teachers suggest, you will surely get a strain with your right finger--hence, this definately would NOT be an ergonomic solution.",Real typers beware - 6 key is on the wrong side,1129766400,
